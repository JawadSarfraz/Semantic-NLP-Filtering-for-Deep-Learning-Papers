Prevalence of computer vision syndrome during the COVID-19 pandemic: a systematic review and meta-analysis,computer vision,None,"BACKGROUND: Computer vision syndrome has become a significant public health problem, especially in developing countries. Therefore, this study aims to identify the prevalence of computer vision syndrome during the COVID-19 pandemic.
METHODS: A systematic review and meta-analysis of the literature was conducted using the databases PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Embase up to February 22, 2023, using the search terms ""Computer Vision Syndrome"" and ""COVID-19"". Three authors independently performed study selection, quality assessment, and data extraction, and the Joanna Briggs Institute Meta-Analysis of Statistics Assessment and Review Instrument was used to evaluate study quality. Heterogeneity was assessed using the statistical test I2, and the R version 4.2.3 program was used for statistical analysis.
RESULTS: A total of 192 studies were retrieved, of which 18 were included in the final meta-analysis. The total sample included 10,337 participants from 12 countries. The combined prevalence of computer vision syndrome was 74% (95% CI: 66, 81). Subgroup analysis based on country revealed a higher prevalence of computer vision syndrome in Pakistan (99%, 95% CI: 97, 100) and a lower prevalence in Turkey (48%, 95% CI: 44, 52). In addition, subgroup analysis based on study subjects showed a prevalence of 82% (95% CI: 74, 89) for computer vision syndrome in non-students and 70% (95% CI: 60, 80) among students.
CONCLUSION: According to the study, 74% of the participants experienced computer vision syndrome during the COVID-19 pandemic. Given this finding, it is essential to implement preventive and therapeutic measures to reduce the risk of developing computer vision syndrome and improve the quality of life of those affected.
TRIAL REGISTRATION: The protocol for this systematic review and meta-analysis was registered in the international registry of systematic reviews, the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO), with registration number CRD42022345965."
UNet segmentation network of COVID-19 CT images with multi-scale attention,other,None,"In recent years, the global outbreak of COVID-19 has posed an extremely serious life-safety risk to humans, and in order to maximize the diagnostic efficiency of physicians, it is extremely valuable to investigate the methods of lesion segmentation in images of COVID-19. Aiming at the problems of existing deep learning models, such as low segmentation accuracy, poor model generalization performance, large model parameters and difficult deployment, we propose an UNet segmentation network integrating multi-scale attention for COVID-19 CT images. Specifically, the UNet network model is utilized as the base network, and the structure of multi-scale convolutional attention is proposed in the encoder stage to enhance the network's ability to capture multi-scale information. Second, a local channel attention module is proposed to extract spatial information by modeling local relationships to generate channel domain weights, to supplement detailed information about the target region to reduce information redundancy and to enhance important information. Moreover, the network model encoder segment uses the Meta-ACON activation function to avoid the overfitting phenomenon of the model and to improve the model's representational ability. A large number of experimental results on publicly available mixed data sets show that compared with the current mainstream image segmentation algorithms, the pro-posed method can more effectively improve the accuracy and generalization performance of COVID-19 lesions segmentation and provide help for medical diagnosis and analysis."
Prevalence of computer vision syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis,computer vision,None,"Although computer vision syndromes are becoming a major public health concern, less emphasis is given to them, particularly in developing countries. There are primary studies on different continents; however, there are inconsistent findings in prevalence among the primary studies. Therefore, this systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to estimate the pooled prevalence of computer vision syndrome. In this study, the review was developed using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Online electronic databases, including PubMed/Medline, CINAHL, and Google Scholar, were used to retrieve published and unpublished studies. The study was conducted from December 1 to April 9/2022. Study selection, quality assessment, and data extraction were performed independently by two authors. Quality assessment of the studies was performed using the Joanna Briggs Institute Meta-Analysis of Statistics Assessment and Review Instrument tool. Heterogeneity was assessed using the statistical test I2. STATA 14 software was used for statistical analysis. A total of 7,35 studies were retrieved, and 45 studies were included in the final meta-analysis. The pooled prevalence of computer vision syndrome was 66% (95% CI: 59, 74). Subgroup analysis based on country was highest in Pakistan (97%, 95% CI: 96, 98) and lowest in Japan (12%, 95% CI: 9, 15). Subgroup analysis based on country showed that studies in Saudi Arabia (I2 = 99.41%, p value &lt; 0.001), Ethiopia (I2 = 72.6%, p value &lt; 0.001), and India (I2 = 98.04%, p value &lt; 0.001) had significant heterogeneity. In the sensitivity analysis, no single study unduly influenced the overall effect estimate. Nearly two in three participants had computer vision syndrome. Thus, preventive practice strategic activities for computer vision syndrome are important interventions."
Analysis and Recognition of Clinical Features of Diabetes Based on Convolutional Neural Network,computer vision,"neural network, convolutional neural network","Diabetes mellitus is a common chronic noncommunicable disease, the main manifestation of which is the long-term high blood sugar level in patients due to metabolic disorders. However, due to excessive reliance on the clinical experience of ophthalmologists, our diagnosis takes a long time, and it is prone to missed diagnosis and misdiagnosis. In recent years, with the development of deep learning, its application in the auxiliary diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy has become possible. How to use the powerful feature extraction ability of deep learning algorithm to realize the mining of massive medical data is of great significance. Therefore, under the action of computer-aided technology, this paper processes and analyzes the retinal images of the fundus through traditional image processing and convolutional neural network-related methods, so as to achieve the role of assisting clinical treatment. Based on the admission records of diabetic patients after data analysis and feature processing, this paper uses an improved convolutional neural network algorithm to establish a model for predicting changes in diabetic conditions. The model can assist doctors to judge the patient's treatment effect by using it based on the case records of inpatient diagnosis and treatment and to predict the risk of readmission of inpatients after discharge. It also can help to judge the effectiveness of the treatment plan. The results of the study show that the model proposed in this paper has a lower probability of misjudging patients with poor recovery as good recovery, and the prediction is more accurate."
"A machine learning model for separating epithelial and stromal regions in oral cavity squamous cell carcinomas using H&E-stained histology images: A multi-center, retrospective study",other,"neural network, convolutional neural network","OBJECTIVE: Tissue slides from Oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma (OC-SCC), particularly the epithelial regions, hold morphologic features that are both diagnostic and prognostic. Yet, previously developed approaches for automated epithelium segmentation in OC-SCC have not been independently tested in a multi-center setting. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effectiveness and applicability of a convolutional neural network (CNN) model to perform epithelial segmentation using digitized H&E-stained diagnostic slides from OC-SCC patients in a multi-center setting.
METHODS: A CNN model was developed to segment the epithelial regions of digitized slides (n = 810), retrospectively collected from five different centers. Deep learning models were trained and validated using well-annotated tissue microarray (TMA) images (n = 212) at various magnifications. The best performing model was locked down and used for independent testing with a total of 478 whole-slide images (WSIs). Manually annotated epithelial regions were used as the reference standard for evaluation. We also compared the model generated results with IHC-stained epithelium (n = 120) as the reference.
RESULTS: The locked-down CNN model trained on the TMA image training cohorts with 10x magnification achieved the best segmentation performance. The locked-down model performed consistently and yielded Pixel Accuracy, Recall Rate, Precision Rate, and Dice Coefficient that ranged from 95.8% to 96.6%, 79.1% to 93.8%, 85.7% to 89.3%, and 82.3% to 89.0%, respectively for the three independent testing WSI cohorts.
CONCLUSION: The automated model achieved a consistently accurate performance for automated epithelial region segmentation compared to manual annotations. This model could be integrated into a computer-aided diagnosis or prognosis system."
Deep Learning applications for COVID-19,both,None,"This survey explores how Deep Learning has battled the COVID-19 pandemic and provides directions for future research on COVID-19. We cover Deep Learning applications in Natural Language Processing, Computer Vision, Life Sciences, and Epidemiology. We describe how each of these applications vary with the availability of big data and how learning tasks are constructed. We begin by evaluating the current state of Deep Learning and conclude with key limitations of Deep Learning for COVID-19 applications. These limitations include Interpretability, Generalization Metrics, Learning from Limited Labeled Data, and Data Privacy. Natural Language Processing applications include mining COVID-19 research for Information Retrieval and Question Answering, as well as Misinformation Detection, and Public Sentiment Analysis. Computer Vision applications cover Medical Image Analysis, Ambient Intelligence, and Vision-based Robotics. Within Life Sciences, our survey looks at how Deep Learning can be applied to Precision Diagnostics, Protein Structure Prediction, and Drug Repurposing. Deep Learning has additionally been utilized in Spread Forecasting for Epidemiology. Our literature review has found many examples of Deep Learning systems to fight COVID-19. We hope that this survey will help accelerate the use of Deep Learning for COVID-19 research."
Deep Transfer Learning for COVID-19 Prediction: Case Study for Limited Data Problems,computer vision,"neural network, convolutional neural network","OBJECTIVE: Automatic prediction of COVID-19 using deep convolution neural networks based pre-trained transfer models and Chest X-ray images.
METHODS: This research employs the advantages of computer vision and medical image analysis to develop an automated model that has the clinical potential for early detection of the disease. Using Deep Learning models, the research aims at evaluating the effectiveness and accuracy of different convolutional neural networks models in the automatic diagnosis of COVID-19 from X-ray images as compared to diagnosis performed by experts in the medical community.
RESULTS: Due to the fact that the dataset available for COVID-19 is still limited, the best model to use is the InceptionNetV3. Performance results show that the InceptionNetV3 model yielded the highest accuracy of 98.63% (with data augmentation) and 98.90% (without data augmentation) among the three models designed. However, as the dataset gets bigger, the Inception ResNetV2 and NASNetlarge will do a better job of classification. All the performed networks tend to over-fit when data augmentation is not used, this is due to the small amount of data used for training and validation.
CONCLUSION: A deep transfer learning is proposed to detecting the COVID-19 automatically from chest X-ray by training it with X-ray images gotten from both COVID-19 patients and people with normal chest X-rays. The study is aimed at helping doctors in making decisions in their clinical practice due its high performance and effectiveness, the study also gives an insight to how transfer learning was used to automatically detect the COVID-19."
Improving the accessibility and transferability of machine learning algorithms for identification of animals in camera trap images: MLWIC2,other,neural network,"Motion-activated wildlife cameras (or ""camera traps"") are frequently used to remotely and noninvasively observe animals. The vast number of images collected from camera trap projects has prompted some biologists to employ machine learning algorithms to automatically recognize species in these images, or at least filter-out images that do not contain animals. These approaches are often limited by model transferability, as a model trained to recognize species from one location might not work as well for the same species in different locations. Furthermore, these methods often require advanced computational skills, making them inaccessible to many biologists. We used 3 million camera trap images from 18 studies in 10 states across the United States of America to train two deep neural networks, one that recognizes 58 species, the ""species model,"" and one that determines if an image is empty or if it contains an animal, the ""empty-animal model."" Our species model and empty-animal model had accuracies of 96.8% and 97.3%, respectively. Furthermore, the models performed well on some out-of-sample datasets, as the species model had 91% accuracy on species from Canada (accuracy range 36%-91% across all out-of-sample datasets) and the empty-animal model achieved an accuracy of 91%-94% on out-of-sample datasets from different continents. Our software addresses some of the limitations of using machine learning to classify images from camera traps. By including many species from several locations, our species model is potentially applicable to many camera trap studies in North America. We also found that our empty-animal model can facilitate removal of images without animals globally. We provide the trained models in an R package (MLWIC2: Machine Learning for Wildlife Image Classification in R), which contains Shiny Applications that allow scientists with minimal programming experience to use trained models and train new models in six neural network architectures with varying depths."
An Intelligent Diagnosis Method of Brain MRI Tumor Segmentation Using Deep Convolutional Neural Network and SVM Algorithm,computer vision,"neural network, convolutional neural network","Among the currently proposed brain segmentation methods, brain tumor segmentation methods based on traditional image processing and machine learning are not ideal enough. Therefore, deep learning-based brain segmentation methods are widely used. In the brain tumor segmentation method based on deep learning, the convolutional network model has a good brain segmentation effect. The deep convolutional network model has the problems of a large number of parameters and large loss of information in the encoding and decoding process. This paper proposes a deep convolutional neural network fusion support vector machine algorithm (DCNN-F-SVM). The proposed brain tumor segmentation model is mainly divided into three stages. In the first stage, a deep convolutional neural network is trained to learn the mapping from image space to tumor marker space. In the second stage, the predicted labels obtained from the deep convolutional neural network training are input into the integrated support vector machine classifier together with the test images. In the third stage, a deep convolutional neural network and an integrated support vector machine are connected in series to train a deep classifier. Run each model on the BraTS dataset and the self-made dataset to segment brain tumors. The segmentation results show that the performance of the proposed model is significantly better than the deep convolutional neural network and the integrated SVM classifier."
Generative Adversarial Networks and Its Applications in Biomedical Informatics,computer vision,neural network,"The basic Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) model is composed of the input vector, generator, and discriminator. Among them, the generator and discriminator are implicit function expressions, usually implemented by deep neural networks. GAN can learn the generative model of any data distribution through adversarial methods with excellent performance. It has been widely applied to different areas since it was proposed in 2014. In this review, we introduced the origin, specific working principle, and development history of GAN, various applications of GAN in digital image processing, Cycle-GAN, and its application in medical imaging analysis, as well as the latest applications of GAN in medical informatics and bioinformatics."
The Impact of Internet and Videogaming Addiction on Adolescent Vision: A Review of the Literature,computer vision,None,"During the past decade, vision problems that were attributed to the use of electronic screens have gradually shifted from being a workplace health issue to a wider public health issue. ""Computer vision syndrome"" originally related to the few professionals exposed to long hours of work in front of a computer screen. The widespread use of digital screens in devices used throughout the day have led to the emergence of ""digital eye strain"" as a new clinical syndrome that affects every individual who spends a large period of time fixated on multiple screens, for work or leisure. A new subcategory, ""video game vision"" has been proposed to specifically address vision issues related to large periods of continuous use of screen enabled devices in order to play video games. With gaming disorder being included in the next version of the WHO classification of diseases (ICD-11), it is becoming increasingly important to have a clear idea of the impact of this disorder in general health and functioning. At the same time, a number of research studies have reported positive impact of videogame playing on the players vision. This article reviews the latest research studies on the impact of digital screen enabled devices on adolescent vision in light of the increasing reports of internet addiction and gaming disorder while referencing positive findings of videogaming on vision in order to provide a balanced approach and assist with classification, diagnosis and treatment, while providing directions for future research."
Prevalence of self-reported computer vision syndrome symptoms and its associated factors among university students,computer vision,None,"PURPOSE: To determine the prevalence of symptoms of computer vision syndrome and to identify its associated factors. The secondary objective was to assess knowledge and practices related to preventing computer vision syndrome symptoms.
METHODS: The data for this cross-sectional study were collected through a self-administered questionnaire distributed to 713 female undergraduates studying business and medicine in Saudi Arabia. The questionnaire included computer vision syndrome validated symptoms and factors associated with computer vision syndrome development.
RESULTS: The most common symptom due to prolonged computer use was neck or shoulder pain, reported by 82.2% of the subjects. Overall, 66.5% of the subjects suffered from headache and 51.5% from dry eyes, in mild, moderate, or severe form. Business students were 1.6 times as likely as medical students to suffer from computer vision syndrome (odds ratio = 1.65; 95% confidence interval: 1.22, 2.24). The use of electronic devices for more than 5 h (odds ratio = 1.52; 95% confidence interval: 1.07, 2.16) was also associated with experiencing computer vision syndrome symptoms. Regarding computer vision syndrome prevention, factors such as hours of use, screen distance, screen brightness, and room illumination showed statistically significant difference between the two groups (p < 0.0001).
CONCLUSION: The prevalence of computer vision syndrome symptoms was significantly higher among business students, who reported lower awareness and poor practice measures of computer use recommendations. Relevant awareness campaigns focusing on the appropriate use of computers are highly recommended."
"Knowledge, Attitude and practice of Computer Vision Syndrome among medical students and its impact on ocular morbidity",computer vision,None,"BACKGROUND: Computer vision syndrome is a common global problem among millions of computer users including medical students. Medical students are preferring soft copies rather than textbooks. The aim of this study was to assess the knowledge, attitude, and practice of MBBS students about Computer vision syndrome, and to identify its ocular morbidity among them.
METHODS: A descriptive cross-sectional survey based on the questionnaire was conducted among 1st- 4th year MBBS students of the Institute of Medicine and 80 students underwent detailed ocular evaluation.
RESULTS: A complete survey response was received from 236 students out of 299 students (Response Rate 80%). The mean age of MBBS students was 21.38 years ± 1.328 years and the range were 19-22 years; 76.2% were male and 23.8% were female. The majority (37.2%) spent 2-3 hours/day on the computer and had a higher risk (p-0.0001) of developing Computer vision syndrome. About 69.5% students used a computer at the level of the eye but there was a significant reduction in Computer vision syndrome (p-0.0001) among those who had computer screen below the eye level. Association between taking breaks (p-0.0001) and frequent blinking (p-0.0411) during computer use and relief of symptoms was significant. Only 22.9% had pre-existing knowledge of Computer vision syndrome and only 25.5% of them were practicing the ideal viewing distance. Among 80 medical students randomly selected for detail eye examinations (63.7% male;36.2% female), the prevalence of Computer vision syndrome  was 71.6%. The commonest ocular complaint was a headache (50%) and dry eyes (45%). Myopia was the commonest refractive error (31.2%) and the orthoptic problem was prevalent among 17.5% students.
CONCLUSIONS: The survey showed that Computer vision syndrome is relevant among MBBS students but the knowledge, attitude, and practice of Computer vision syndrome among them is poor."
Ossification area localization in pediatric hand radiographs using deep neural networks for object detection,other,neural network,"BACKGROUND: Detection of ossification areas of hand bones in X-ray images is an important task, e.g. as a preprocessing step in automated bone age estimation. Deep neural networks have emerged recently as de facto standard detection methods, but their drawback is the need of large annotated datasets. Finetuning pre-trained networks is a viable alternative, but it is not clear a priori if training with small annotated datasets will be successful, as it depends on the problem at hand. In this paper, we show that pre-trained networks can be utilized to produce an effective detector of ossification areas in pediatric X-ray images of hands.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: A publicly available Faster R-CNN network, pre-trained on the COCO dataset, was utilized and finetuned with 240 manually annotated radiographs from the RSNA Pediatric Bone Age Challenge, which comprises over 14.000 pediatric radiographs. The validation is done on another 89 radiographs from the dataset and the performance is measured by Intersection-over-Union (IoU). To understand the effect of the data size on the pre-trained network, subsampling was applied to the training data and the training was repeated. Additionally, the network was trained from scratch without any pre-trained weights. Finally, to understand whether the trained model could be useful, we compared the inference of the network to an annotation of an expert radiologist. The finetuned network was able to achieve an average precision (mAP@0.5IoU) of 92.92 ± 1.93. Apart from the wrist region, all ossification areas were able to benefit from more data. In contrast, the network trained from scratch was not able to produce any correct results. When compared to the annotations of the expert radiologist, the network was able to localize the regions quite well, as the F1-Score was on average 91.85 ± 1.06.
CONCLUSIONS: By finetuning a pre-trained deep neural network, with 240 annotated radiographs, we were able to successfully detect ossification areas in prediatric hand radiographs."
"Mono-exponential, diffusion kurtosis and stretched exponential diffusion MR imaging response to chemoradiation in newly diagnosed glioblastoma",other,None,"PURPOSE: To quantify changes and prognostic value of diffusion MRI measurements obtained using mono-exponential, diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI) and stretched exponential (SE) models prior and after chemoradiation in newly diagnosed glioblastoma (GBM).
METHODS: Diffusion-weighted images (DWIs) were acquired in twenty-three patients following surgery, prior chemoradiation and within 7 days following completion of treatment, using b-values ranging from 0 to 5000s/mm2. Mono-exponential diffusion (apparent diffusion coefficient: ADC), isotropic (non-directional) DKI model with apparent diffusivity (Dapp) and kurtosis (Kapp) estimates as well as SE model with distributed-diffusion coefficient (DDC) and mean intra-voxel heterogeneity (α) were computed for all patients prior and after chemoradiation. Median values were calculated for normal appearing white matter (NAWM) and contrast-enhancing tumor (CET). The magnitudes of diffusion change prior and after chemoradiation were used to predict overall survival (OS).
RESULTS: Diffusivity in NAWM was consistent for all diffusion measures during chemoradiation, while diffusivity measurements (ADC, Dapp and DDC) within CET changed significantly. A strong positive correlation existed between ADC, Dapp, and DDC measurements prior to chemoradiation; however, this association was weak following chemoradiation, suggesting a more complex microstructural environment after cytotoxic therapy. When combined with baseline tumor volume and MGMT status, age and ADC changes added significant prognostic values, whereas more complex diffusion models did not show significant value in predicting OS.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite increased tissue complexity following chemoradiation, advanced diffusion models have longer acquisition times, provide largely comparable measures of diffusivity, and do not appear to provide additional prognostic value compared to mono-exponential ADC maps."
Artificial neural networks for cancer research: outcome prediction,computer vision,"neural network, artificial neural network","The use of artificial neural networks in biological and medical research has increased tremendously in the last few years. Artificial neural networks are being used in cancer research for image processing, the analysis of laboratory data for breast cancer diagnosis, the discovery of chemotherapeutic agents, and for cancer outcome prediction. A neural network generalizes from the input data to patterns inherent in the data, and its uses these patterns to make predictions or to classify. This paper explains how neural networks work, and it shows that a neural network is more accurate at predicting breast cancer patient outcome than the current staging system."
Improvement in specificity of ultrasonography for diagnosis of breast tumors by means of artificial intelligence,computer vision,"neural network, artificial neural network","A set of ultrasonograms of lesions from 200 patients between the ages of 14 and 93 years who underwent mammography followed by ultrasonographic examination and excisional biopsy has been studied with computer vision techniques to improve the ultrasonographic specificity of the diagnosis. Selected features representing the texture of the lesion were calculated and then classified by an artificial neural network. This network was biased toward correctly classifying all the malignant cases at the expense of some misclassification of the benign cases. The network diagnosed the malignant cases with 100% sensitivity and 40% specificity (compared with 0% specificity for the radiologists diagnosing the same set of cases in the breast imaging setting), and tests performed with a leave-one-out technique indicate that the network will generalize well to new cases. This suggests that methods based on neural network classification of texture features show promise for potentially decreasing the number of unnecessary biopsies by a significant amount in patients with sonographically identifiable lesions."
SAPPNet: students' academic performance prediction during COVID-19 using neural network,other,"neural network, artificial neural network, convolutional neural network","A variety of reasons have made it more difficult for educators and tutors to anticipate students' performance. Numerous researchers have used various predictive models to identify students who may be at-risk of dropping out early. Additionally, these methods were used to forecast final semester grades based on various datasets. However, these prediction models still fall short of meeting educational management requirements. In this paper, we propose the deep learning (DL) based model named students academic performance prediction network (SAPPNet) to predict the students' grades. We consider the questionnaire-based Jordan University dataset which contains demographic information, usage of digital tools before and after COVID-19, sleep times before and after COVID-19, social interaction, psychological state, and academic performance. SAPPNet consists of spatial convolution modules which are designed to extract spatial dependencies includes categorical and numerical attributes that represent static features (gender, level/year, age, digital tools used before and after COVID-19, psychological condition using prolonged e-learning tools) and temporal module for temporal dependencies involves sequences that capture changes before and after COVID-19. Additionally, we also try to implement classical machine learning (ML) models including support vector machine, k nearest neighbor, decision tree, and random forest, and DL models named artificial neural network, convolutional neural network, long short-term memory, and students learning prediction network. Simulation results show that SAPPNet achieved the best performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, with an accuracy, precision, recall, and an F1-score of 93 %  . The proposed model with spatial and temporal modules improves the prediction performance, and it implies new aspect of the educational dataset."
Predicting SARS-CoV-2 infection among hemodialysis patients using deep neural network methods,other,"neural network, convolutional neural network, recurrent neural network","COVID-19 has a higher rate of morbidity and mortality among dialysis patients than the general population. Identifying infected patients early with the support of predictive models helps dialysis centers implement concerted procedures (e.g., temperature screenings, universal masking, isolation treatments) to control the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and mitigate outbreaks. We collect data from multiple sources, including demographics, clinical, treatment, laboratory, vaccination, socioeconomic status, and COVID-19 surveillance. Previous early prediction models, such as logistic regression, SVM, and XGBoost, require sophisticated feature engineering and need improved prediction performance. We create deep learning models, including Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), to predict SARS-CoV-2 infections during incubation. Our study shows deep learning models with minimal feature engineering can identify those infected patients more accurately than previously built models. Our Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model consistently performed well, with an AUC exceeding 0.80, peaking at 0.91 in August 2021. The CNN model also demonstrated strong results with an AUC above 0.75. Both models outperformed previous best XGBoost models by over 0.10 in AUC. Prediction accuracy declined as the pandemic evolved, dropping to approximately 0.75 between September 2021 and January 2022. Maintaining a 20% false positive rate, our LSTM and CNN models identified 66% and 64% of positive cases among patients, significantly outperforming XGBoost models at 42%. We also identify key features for dialysis patients by calculating the gradient of the output with respect to the input features. By closely monitoring these factors, dialysis patients can receive earlier diagnoses and care, leading to less severe outcomes. Our research highlights the effectiveness of deep neural networks in analyzing longitudinal data, especially in predicting COVID-19 infections during the crucial incubation period. These deep network approaches surpass traditional methods relying on aggregated variable means, significantly improving the accurate identification of SARS-CoV-2 infections."
Joint self-supervised and supervised contrastive learning for multimodal MRI data: Towards predicting abnormal neurodevelopment,other,None,"The integration of different imaging modalities, such as structural, diffusion tensor, and functional magnetic resonance imaging, with deep learning models has yielded promising outcomes in discerning phenotypic characteristics and enhancing disease diagnosis. The development of such a technique hinges on the efficient fusion of heterogeneous multimodal features, which initially reside within distinct representation spaces. Naively fusing the multimodal features does not adequately capture the complementary information and could even produce redundancy. In this work, we present a novel joint self-supervised and supervised contrastive learning method to learn the robust latent feature representation from multimodal MRI data, allowing the projection of heterogeneous features into a shared common space, and thereby amalgamating both complementary and analogous information across various modalities and among similar subjects. We performed a comparative analysis between our proposed method and alternative deep multimodal learning approaches. Through extensive experiments on two independent datasets, the results demonstrated that our method is significantly superior to several other deep multimodal learning methods in predicting abnormal neurodevelopment. Our method has the capability to facilitate computer-aided diagnosis within clinical practice, harnessing the power of multimodal data. The source code of the proposed model is publicly accessible on GitHub: https://github.com/leonzyzy/Contrastive-Network."
Validation of an Artificial Intelligence-Based Prediction Model Using 5 External PET/CT Datasets of Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma,other,None,"The aim of this study was to validate a previously developed deep learning model in 5 independent clinical trials. The predictive performance of this model was compared with the international prognostic index (IPI) and 2 models incorporating radiomic PET/CT features (clinical PET and PET models). Methods: In total, 1,132 diffuse large B-cell lymphoma patients were included: 296 for training and 836 for external validation. The primary outcome was 2-y time to progression. The deep learning model was trained on maximum-intensity projections from PET/CT scans. The clinical PET model included metabolic tumor volume, maximum distance from the bulkiest lesion to another lesion, SUV<sub>peak</sub>, age, and performance status. The PET model included metabolic tumor volume, maximum distance from the bulkiest lesion to another lesion, and SUV<sub>peak</sub> Model performance was assessed using the area under the curve (AUC) and Kaplan-Meier curves. Results: The IPI yielded an AUC of 0.60 on all external data. The deep learning model yielded a significantly higher AUC of 0.66 (P &lt; 0.01). For each individual clinical trial, the model was consistently better than IPI. Radiomic model AUCs remained higher for all clinical trials. The deep learning and clinical PET models showed equivalent performance (AUC, 0.69; P &gt; 0.05). The PET model yielded the highest AUC of all models (AUC, 0.71; P &lt; 0.05). Conclusion: The deep learning model predicted outcome in all trials with a higher performance than IPI and better survival curve separation. This model can predict treatment outcome in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma without tumor delineation but at the cost of a lower prognostic performance than with radiomics."
Ascle-A Python Natural Language Processing Toolkit for Medical Text Generation: Development and Evaluation Study,text mining,None,"BACKGROUND: Medical texts present significant domain-specific challenges, and manually curating these texts is a time-consuming and labor-intensive process. To address this, natural language processing (NLP) algorithms have been developed to automate text processing. In the biomedical field, various toolkits for text processing exist, which have greatly improved the efficiency of handling unstructured text. However, these existing toolkits tend to emphasize different perspectives, and none of them offer generation capabilities, leaving a significant gap in the current offerings.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to describe the development and preliminary evaluation of Ascle. Ascle is tailored for biomedical researchers and clinical staff with an easy-to-use, all-in-one solution that requires minimal programming expertise. For the first time, Ascle provides 4 advanced and challenging generative functions: question-answering, text summarization, text simplification, and machine translation. In addition, Ascle integrates 12 essential NLP functions, along with query and search capabilities for clinical databases.
METHODS: We fine-tuned 32 domain-specific language models and evaluated them thoroughly on 27 established benchmarks. In addition, for the question-answering task, we developed a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework for large language models that incorporated a medical knowledge graph with ranking techniques to enhance the reliability of generated answers. Additionally, we conducted a physician validation to assess the quality of generated content beyond automated metrics.
RESULTS: The fine-tuned models and RAG framework consistently enhanced text generation tasks. For example, the fine-tuned models improved the machine translation task by 20.27 in terms of BLEU score.

Deep learning-based approaches for multi-omics data integration and analysis,other,"neural network, feedforward neural network, convolutional neural network","BACKGROUND: The rapid growth of deep learning, as well as the vast and ever-growing amount of available data, have provided ample opportunity for advances in fusion and analysis of complex and heterogeneous data types. Different data modalities provide complementary information that can be leveraged to gain a more complete understanding of each subject. In the biomedical domain, multi-omics data includes molecular (genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, epigenomics, metabolomics, etc.) and imaging (radiomics, pathomics) modalities which, when combined, have the potential to improve performance on prediction, classification, clustering and other tasks. Deep learning encompasses a wide variety of methods, each of which have certain strengths and weaknesses for multi-omics integration.
METHOD: In this review, we categorize recent deep learning-based approaches by their basic architectures and discuss their unique capabilities in relation to one another. We also discuss some emerging themes advancing the field of multi-omics integration.
RESULTS: Deep learning-based multi-omics integration methods were categorized broadly into non-generative (feedforward neural networks, graph convolutional neural networks, and autoencoders) and generative (variational methods, generative adversarial models, and a generative pretrained model). Generative methods have the advantage of being able to impose constraints on the shared representations to enforce certain properties or incorporate prior knowledge. They can also be used to generate or impute missing modalities. Recent advances achieved by these methods include the ability to handle incomplete data as well as going beyond the traditional molecular omics data types to integrate other modalities such as imaging data.
CONCLUSION: We expect to see further growth in methods that can handle missingness, as this is a common challenge in working with complex and heterogeneous data. Additionally, methods that integrate more data types are expected to improve performance on downstream tasks by capturing a comprehensive view of each sample."

Our research addresses the critical need to understand public sentiment across various dimensions of this crisis by integrating data from multiple modalities, such as text, images, audio, and videos sourced from platforms like Twitter. Conventional methods, which primarily focus on text analysis, often fall short in capturing the nuanced intricacies of emotional states, necessitating a more comprehensive approach. To tackle this challenge, our proposed framework introduces a novel hybrid model, IChOA-CNN-LSTM, which leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for precise image feature extraction, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for sequential data analysis, and an Improved Chimp Optimization Algorithm for effective feature fusion. Remarkably, our model achieves an impressive accuracy rate of 97.8%, outperforming existing approaches in the field. Additionally, by integrating the GeoCoV19 dataset, we facilitate a comprehensive analysis that spans linguistic and geographical boundaries, enriching our understanding of global pandemic discourse and providing critical insights for informed decision-making in public health crises. Through this holistic approach and innovative techniques, our research significantly advances multimodal sentiment analysis, offering a robust framework for deciphering the complex interplay of emotions during unprecedented global challenges like the COVID-19 pandemic."
Prediction of mortality events of patients with acute heart failure in intensive care unit based on deep neural network,other,"neural network, machine learning model, recurrent neural network","BACKGROUND: Acute heart failure (AHF) in the intensive care unit (ICU) is characterized by its criticality, rapid progression, complex and changeable condition, and its pathophysiological process involves the interaction of multiple organs and systems. This makes it difficult to predict in-hospital mortality events comprehensively and accurately. Traditional analysis methods based on statistics and machine learning suffer from insufficient model performance, poor accuracy caused by prior dependence, and difficulty in adequately considering the complex relationships between multiple risk factors. Therefore, the application of deep neural network (DNN) techniques to the specific scenario, predicting mortality events of patients with AHF under intensive care, has become a research frontier.
METHODS: This research utilized the MIMIC-IV critical care database as the primary data source and employed the synthetic minority over-sampling technique (SMOTE) to balance the dataset. Deep neural network models-backpropagation neural network (BPNN) and recurrent neural network (RNN), which are based on electronic medical record data mining, were employed to investigate the in-hospital death event judgment task of patients with AHF under intensive care. Additionally, multiple single machine learning models and ensemble learning models were constructed for comparative experiments. Moreover, we achieved various optimal performance combinations by modifying the classification threshold of deep neural network models to address the diverse real-world requirements in the ICU. Finally, we conducted an interpretable deep model using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) to uncover the most influential medical record features for each patient from the aspects of global and local interpretation.
RESULTS: In terms of model performance in this scenario, deep neural network models outperform both single machine learning models and ensemble learning models, achieving the highest Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 value, and Area under the ROC curve, which can reach 0.949, 0.925, 0.983, 0.953, and 0.987 respectively. SHAP value analysis revealed that the ICU scores (APSIII, OASIS, SOFA) are significantly correlated with the occurrence of in-hospital fatal events.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study underscores that DNN-based mortality event classifier offers a novel intelligent approach for forecasting and assessing the prognosis of AHF patients in the ICU. Additionally, the ICU scores stand out as the most predictive features, which implies that in the decision-making process of the models, ICU scores can provide the most crucial information, making the greatest positive or negative contribution to influence the incidence of in-hospital mortality among patients with acute heart failure."
Multimodal ischemic stroke recurrence prediction model based on the capsule neural network and support vector machine,other,neural network,"Ischemic stroke (IS) has a high recurrence rate. Machine learning (ML) models have been developed based on single-modal biochemical tests, and imaging data have been used to predict stroke recurrence. However, the prediction accuracy of these models is not sufficiently high. Therefore, this study aimed to collect biochemical detection and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data to establish a dataset and propose a high-performance heterogeneous multimodal IS recurrence prediction model based on deep learning. This is a retrospective cohort study. Data were retrospectively collected from 634 IS patients in Zhuhai, China, a 12-month follow-up was conducted to determine stroke recurrence. We propose the ischemic stroke multi-group learning (ISGL) model, an integrated model for predicting the recurrence risk of multimodal IS in patients, based on a capsule neural network and a linear support vector machine (SVM). Two capsule neural network prediction models based on T1 and T2 signals in the MRI data and a SVM prediction model based on biochemical test data were established. Finally, a vote was conducted on the final judgment of the integrated model. The ISGL model was compared with 6 classical ML and deep learning models: k-nearest neighbors, SVM, logistic regression, random forest, eXtreme Gradient Boosting, and visual geometry group. The results revealed that the accuracy, specificity, sensitivity and the area under the curve of the ISGL model were 95%, 96%, 94%, and 95%, respectively. Among the comparison models, the visual geometry group method exhibited the best performance, but it much lower than those of the ISGL model. Analysis of the importance of biochemical test data revealed that low-density lipoprotein, smoking, and heart disease history were the positively correlated factors, and total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein, and diabetes were and the negatively correlated factors. This study proposes the ISGL model can be used simultaneously with MRI and biochemical data to predict IS recurrence. This combination resulted in higher rate of performance than that of the other ML models. Additionally, this study found related risk factors affected recurrence, which can be used to intervene in high-risk patients' recurrence as early as possible and promote the development of secondary prevention of stroke."
"Forecasting and analyzing influenza activity in Hebei Province, China, using a CNN-LSTM hybrid model",other,neural network,"BACKGROUND: Influenza, an acute infectious respiratory disease, presents a significant global health challenge. Accurate prediction of influenza activity is crucial for reducing its impact. Therefore, this study seeks to develop a hybrid Convolution Neural Network-Long Short Term Memory neural network (CNN-LSTM) model to forecast the percentage of influenza-like-illness (ILI) rate in Hebei Province, China. The aim is to provide more precise guidance for influenza prevention and control measures.
METHODS: Using ILI% data from 28 national sentinel hospitals in the Hebei Province, spanning from 2010 to 2022, we employed the Python deep learning framework PyTorch to develop the CNN-LSTM model. Additionally, we utilized R and Python to develop four other models commonly used for predicting infectious diseases. After constructing the models, we employed these models to make retrospective predictions, and compared each model's prediction performance using mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), and other evaluation metrics.
RESULTS: Based on historical ILI% data from 28 national sentinel hospitals in Hebei Province, the Seasonal Auto-Regressive Indagate Moving Average (SARIMA), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Convolution Neural Network (CNN), Long Short Term Memory neural network (LSTM) models were constructed. On the testing set, all models effectively predicted the ILI% trends. Subsequently, these models were used to forecast over different time spans. Across various forecasting periods, the CNN-LSTM model demonstrated the best predictive performance, followed by the XGBoost model, LSTM model, CNN model, and SARIMA model, which exhibited the least favorable performance.
CONCLUSION: The hybrid CNN-LSTM model had better prediction performances than the SARIMA model, CNN model, LSTM model, and XGBoost model. This hybrid model could provide more accurate influenza activity projections in the Hebei Province."
Extracting Pulmonary Nodules and Nodule Characteristics from Radiology Reports of Lung Cancer Screening Patients Using Transformer Models,text mining,"neural network, recurrent neural network","UNLABELLED: Pulmonary nodules and nodule characteristics are important indicators of lung nodule malignancy. However, nodule information is often documented as free text in clinical narratives such as radiology reports in electronic health record systems. Natural language processing (NLP) is the key technology to extract and standardize patient information from radiology reports into structured data elements. This study aimed to develop an NLP system using state-of-the-art transformer models to extract pulmonary nodules and associated nodule characteristics from radiology reports. We identified a cohort of 3080 patients who underwent LDCT at the University of Florida health system and collected their radiology reports. We manually annotated 394 reports as the gold standard. We explored eight pretrained transformer models from three transformer architectures including bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT), robustly optimized BERT approach (RoBERTa), and A Lite BERT (ALBERT), for clinical concept extraction, relation identification, and negation detection. We examined general transformer models pretrained using general English corpora, transformer models fine-tuned using a clinical corpus, and a large clinical transformer model, GatorTron, which was trained from scratch using 90 billion words of clinical text. We compared transformer models with two baseline models including a recurrent neural network implemented using bidirectional long short-term memory with a conditional random fields layer and support vector machines. RoBERTa-mimic achieved the best F1-score of 0.9279 for nodule concept and nodule characteristics extraction. ALBERT-base and GatorTron achieved the best F1-score of 0.9737 in linking nodule characteristics to pulmonary nodules. Seven out of eight transformers achieved the best F1-score of 1.0000 for negation detection. Our end-to-end system achieved an overall F1-score of 0.8869. This study demonstrated the advantage of state-of-the-art transformer models for pulmonary nodule information extraction from radiology reports.

A GPT-based EHR modeling system for unsupervised novel disease detection,other,None,"OBJECTIVE: To develop an Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based anomaly detection model as a complement of an ""astute physician"" in detecting novel disease cases in a hospital and preventing emerging outbreaks.
METHODS: Data included hospitalized patients (n = 120,714) at a safety-net hospital in Massachusetts. A novel Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT)-based clinical anomaly detection system was designed and further trained using Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM), which can model a hospitalized patient's Electronic Health Records (EHR) and detect atypical patients. Methods and performance metrics, similar to the ones behind the recent Large Language Models (LLMs), were leveraged to capture the dynamic evolution of the patient's clinical variables and compute an Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) anomaly score.
RESULTS: In a completely unsupervised setting, hospitalizations for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection could have been predicted by our GPT model at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, with an Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC) of 92.2 %, using 31 extracted clinical variables and a 3-day detection window. Our GPT achieves individual patient-level anomaly detection and mortality prediction AUC of 78.3 % and 94.7 %, outperforming traditional linear models by 6.6 % and 9 %, respectively. Different types of clinical trajectories of a SARS-CoV-2 infection are captured by our model to make interpretable detections, while a trend of over-pessimistic outcome prediction yields a more effective detection pathway. Furthermore, our comprehensive GPT model can potentially assist clinicians with forecasting patient clinical variables and developing personalized treatment plans.
CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that an emerging outbreak can be accurately detected within a hospital, by using a GPT to model patient EHR time sequences and labeling them as anomalous when actual outcomes are not supported by the model. Such a GPT is also a comprehensive model with the functionality of generating future patient clinical variables, which can potentially assist clinicians in developing personalized treatment plans."
Multimodal data integration for oncology in the era of deep neural networks: a review,other,neural network,"Cancer research encompasses data across various scales, modalities, and resolutions, from screening and diagnostic imaging to digitized histopathology slides to various types of molecular data and clinical records. The integration of these diverse data types for personalized cancer care and predictive modeling holds the promise of enhancing the accuracy and reliability of cancer screening, diagnosis, and treatment. Traditional analytical methods, which often focus on isolated or unimodal information, fall short of capturing the complex and heterogeneous nature of cancer data. The advent of deep neural networks has spurred the development of sophisticated multimodal data fusion techniques capable of extracting and synthesizing information from disparate sources. Among these, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Transformers have emerged as powerful tools for multimodal learning, demonstrating significant success.

We delve into the recent advancements in GNNs and Transformers for the fusion of multimodal data in oncology, spotlighting key studies and their pivotal findings. We discuss the unique challenges of multimodal learning, such as data heterogeneity and integration complexities, alongside the opportunities it presents for a more nuanced and comprehensive understanding of cancer. Finally, we present some of the latest comprehensive multimodal pan-cancer data sources. By surveying the landscape of multimodal data integration in oncology, our goal is to underline the transformative potential of multimodal GNNs and Transformers.

Masked pre-training of transformers for histology image analysis,other,None,"In digital pathology, whole-slide images (WSIs) are widely used for applications such as cancer diagnosis and prognosis prediction. Vision transformer (ViT) models have recently emerged as a promising method for encoding large regions of WSIs while preserving spatial relationships among patches. However, due to the large number of model parameters and limited labeled data, applying transformer models to WSIs remains challenging. In this study, we propose a pretext task to train the transformer model in a self-supervised manner. Our model, MaskHIT, uses the transformer output to reconstruct masked patches, measured by contrastive loss. We pre-trained MaskHIT model using over 7000 WSIs from TCGA and extensively evaluated its performance in multiple experiments, covering survival prediction, cancer subtype classification, and grade prediction tasks. Our experiments demonstrate that the pre-training procedure enables context-aware understanding of WSIs, facilitates the learning of representative histological features based on patch positions and visual patterns, and is essential for the ViT model to achieve optimal results on WSI-level tasks. The pre-trained MaskHIT surpasses various multiple instance learning approaches by 3% and 2% on survival prediction and cancer subtype classification tasks, and also outperforms recent state-of-the-art transformer-based methods. Finally, a comparison between the attention maps generated by the MaskHIT model with pathologist's annotations indicates that the model can accurately identify clinically relevant histological structures on the whole slide for each task."
A deep learning approach for overall survival prediction in lung cancer with missing values,other,None,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: In the field of lung cancer research, particularly in the analysis of overall survival (OS), artificial intelligence (AI) serves crucial roles with specific aims. Given the prevalent issue of missing data in the medical domain, our primary objective is to develop an AI model capable of dynamically handling this missing data. Additionally, we aim to leverage all accessible data, effectively analyzing both uncensored patients who have experienced the event of interest and censored patients who have not, by embedding a specialized technique within our AI model, not commonly utilized in other AI tasks. Through the realization of these objectives, our model aims to provide precise OS predictions for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients, thus overcoming these significant challenges.
METHODS: We present a novel approach to survival analysis with missing values in the context of NSCLC, which exploits the strengths of the transformer architecture to account only for available features without requiring any imputation strategy. More specifically, this model tailors the transformer architecture to tabular data by adapting its feature embedding and masked self-attention to mask missing data and fully exploit the available ones. By making use of ad-hoc designed losses for OS, it is able to account for both censored and uncensored patients, as well as changes in risks over time.
RESULTS: We compared our method with state-of-the-art models for survival analysis coupled with different imputation strategies. We evaluated the results obtained over a period of 6 years using different time granularities obtaining a Ct-index, a time-dependent variant of the C-index, of 71.97, 77.58 and 80.72 for time units of 1 month, 1 year and 2 years, respectively, outperforming all state-of-the-art methods regardless of the imputation method used.
CONCLUSIONS: The results show that our model not only outperforms the state-of-the-art's performance but also simplifies the analysis in the presence of missing data, by effectively eliminating the need to identify the most appropriate imputation strategy for predicting OS in NSCLC patients."
Tab-Cox: An Interpretable Deep Survival Analysis Model for Patients With Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma Based on TabNet,other,neural network,"The nutritional status of cancer patients is closely associated with the clinical progression of the disease. A survival analysis model combined with a neural network can predict future disease trends in patients, facilitating early prevention and assisting physicians in making diagnoses. However, the complexity of neural networks and their incompatibility with medical tabular data can reduce the interpretability of the model. To address this issue, thr paper propose a novel survival analysis model called Tab-Cox, which combines TabNet and Cox models. This model is specifically designed to predict the survival outcomes of patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma. The model utilizes TabNet's sequential attention mechanism to extract more interpretable features, providing an interpretable method for identifying disease risk factors. Consequently, the model ensures accurate survival prediction while also making the results more comprehensible for both patients and doctors. The paper tested the efficacy of the model by conducting experiments on various diverse datasets in comparison with other commonly used survival models. The results showed that the proposed model delivered the highest or second-highest accuracy across all datasets. Furthermore, the paper conducted a comparative interpretability analysis against the classical Cox model. In addition and compare the interpretability of the Tab-Cox model with the classical Cox model and discuss the advantages and disadvantages of its interpretability. This demonstrates that Tab-Cox can assist doctors in identifying risk factors that are challenging to capture using artificial methods."

METHODS: In this population-based cohort study, we used the characteristics of patients diagnosed with CC between 2010 and 2015 from the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) database. The population was randomized into a training set (n = 10 596, 70%) and a test set (n = 4536, 30%). Brier scores, area under the (AUC) receiver operating characteristic curve and calibration curves were used to compare the performance of the three most popular deep learning models, namely, artificial neural networks (ANN), deep neural networks (DNN), and long-short term memory (LSTM) neural networks with Cox proportional hazard (CPH) model.
RESULTS: In the independent test set, the Brier values of ANN, DNN, LSTM and CPH were 0.155, 0.149, 0.148, and 0.170, respectively. The AUC values were 0.906 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.897-0.916), 0.908 (95% CI 0.899-0.918), 0.910 (95% CI 0.901-0.919), and 0.793 (95% CI 0.769-0.816), respectively. Deep learning showed superior promising results than CPH in predicting CC specific survival.
CONCLUSIONS: Deep learning showed potential advantages over traditional CPH models in terms of prognostic assessment and treatment recommendations. LSTM exhibited optimal predictive accuracy and has the ability to provide reliable information on individual survival and treatment recommendations for CC patients."
Interpretable (not just posthoc-explainable) medical claims modeling for discharge placement to reduce preventable all-cause readmissions or death,other,neural network,"We developed an inherently interpretable multilevel Bayesian framework for representing variation in regression coefficients that mimics the piecewise linearity of ReLU-activated deep neural networks. We used the framework to formulate a survival model for using medical claims to predict hospital readmission and death that focuses on discharge placement, adjusting for confounding in estimating causal local average treatment effects. We trained the model on a 5% sample of Medicare beneficiaries from 2008 and 2011, based on their 2009-2011 inpatient episodes (approximately 1.2 million), and then tested the model on 2012 episodes (approximately 400 thousand). The model scored an out-of-sample AUROC of approximately 0.75 on predicting all-cause readmissions-defined using official Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) methodology-or death within 30-days of discharge, being competitive against XGBoost and a Bayesian deep neural network, demonstrating that one need-not sacrifice interpretability for accuracy. Crucially, as a regression model, it provides what blackboxes cannot-its exact gold-standard global interpretation, explicitly defining how the model performs its internal ""reasoning"" for mapping the input data features to predictions. In doing so, we identify relative risk factors and quantify the effect of discharge placement. We also show that the posthoc explainer SHAP provides explanations that are inconsistent with the ground truth model reasoning that our model readily admits."

Diffusion-Based Generative Network for de Novo Synthetic Promoter Design,other,None,"Computer-aided promoter design is a major development trend in synthetic promoter engineering. Various deep learning models have been used to evaluate or screen synthetic promoters, but there have been few works on de novo promoter design. To explore the potential ability of generative models in promoter design, we established a diffusion-based generative model for promoter design in Escherichia coli. The model was completely driven by sequence data and could study the essential characteristics of natural promoters, thus generating synthetic promoters similar to natural promoters in structure and component. We also improved the calculation method of FID indicator, using a convolution layer to extract the feature matrix of the promoter sequence instead. As a result, we got an FID equal to 1.37, which meant synthetic promoters have a distribution similar to that of natural ones. Our work provides a fresh approach to de novo promoter design, indicating that a completely data-driven generative model is feasible for promoter design."

Cancer Antigen 125 (CA125) is the best-performing ovarian cancer biomarker which however is still not effective as a screening test in the general population. Recent literature reports additional biomarkers with the potential to improve on CA125 for early detection when using longitudinal multimarker models.
METHODS: Our data comprised 180 controls and 44 cases with serum samples sourced from the multimodal arm of UK Collaborative Trial of Ovarian Cancer Screening (UKCTOCS). Our models were based on Bayesian change-point detection and recurrent neural networks.
RESULTS: We obtained a significantly higher performance for CA125-HE4 model using both methodologies (AUC 0.971, sensitivity 96.7% and AUC 0.987, sensitivity 96.7%) with respect to CA125 (AUC 0.949, sensitivity 90.8% and AUC 0.953, sensitivity 92.1%) for Bayesian change-point model (BCP) and recurrent neural networks (RNN) approaches, respectively. One year before diagnosis, the CA125-HE4 model also ranked as the best, whereas at 2 years before diagnosis no multimarker model outperformed CA125.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study identified and tested different combination of biomarkers using longitudinal multivariable models that outperformed CA125 alone. We showed the potential of multivariable models and candidate biomarkers to increase the detection rate of ovarian cancer."
TDFFM: Transformer and Deep Forest Fusion Model for Predicting Coronavirus 3C-Like Protease Cleavage Sites,other,None,"COVID-19, caused by the highly contagious SARS-CoV-2 virus, is distinguished by its positive-sense, single-stranded RNA genome. A thorough understanding of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis is crucial for halting its proliferation. Notably, the 3C-like protease of the coronavirus (denoted as 3CLpro) is instrumental in the viral replication process. Precise delineation of 3CLpro cleavage sites is imperative for elucidating the transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2. While machine learning tools have been deployed to identify potential 3CLpro cleavage sites, these existing methods often fall short in terms of accuracy. To improve the performances of these predictions, we propose a novel analytical framework, the Transformer and Deep Forest Fusion Model (TDFFM). Within TDFFM, we utilize the AAindex and the BLOSUM62 matrix to encode protein sequences. These encoded features are subsequently input into two distinct components: a Deep Forest, which is an effective decision tree ensemble methodology, and a Transformer equipped with a Multi-Level Attention Model (TMLAM). The integration of the attention mechanism allows our model to more accurately identify positive samples, thus enhancing the overall predictive performance. Evaluation on a test set demonstrates that our TDFFM achieves an accuracy of 0.955, an AUC of 0.980, and an F1-score of 0.367, substantiating the model's superior prediction capabilities."
Advancing mortality rate prediction in European population clusters: integrating deep learning and multiscale analysis,other,neural network,"Accurately predicting population mortality rates is crucial for effective retirement insurance and economic policy formulation. Recent advancements in deep learning time series forecasting (DLTSF) have led to improved mortality rate predictions compared to traditional models like Lee-Carter (LC). This study focuses on mortality rate prediction in large clusters across Europe. By utilizing PCA dimensionality reduction and statistical clustering techniques, we integrate age features from high-dimensional mortality data of multiple countries, analyzing their similarities and differences. To capture the heterogeneous characteristics, an adaptive adjustment matrix is generated, incorporating sequential variation and spatial geographical information. Additionally, a combination of graph neural networks and a transformer network with an adaptive adjustment matrix is employed to capture the spatiotemporal features between different clusters. Extensive numerical experiments using data from the Human Mortality Database validate the superiority of the proposed GT-A model over traditional LC models and other classic neural networks in terms of prediction accuracy. Consequently, the GT-A model serves as a powerful forecasting tool for global population studies and the international life insurance field."

RESULTS: Within the internal and external validation cohorts, the deep learning model (concordance index [C-index] 0.745, 0.733) was far superior to the clinical model (C-index: 0.635, 0.630) in predicting OS, but slightly worse than the combined model (C-index: 0.771, 0.770). Additionally, the deep learning model had excellent calibration, clinical usefulness, and improved accuracy in classifying survival outcomes. Remarkably, patients at high risk had a survival benefit from PCI in both the limited and extensive stages (all P < 0.05), whereas no significant association was observed in patients at low risk.
CONCLUSIONS: The CT-based deep learning model exhibited promising performance in predicting the OS of SCLC patients. The OS signature may aid in individualized treatment planning to select patients who may benefit from PCI."
"Exploring the potential of learning methods and recurrent dynamic model with vaccination: A comparative case study of COVID-19 in Austria, Brazil, and China",other,None,"In order to effectively manage infectious diseases, it is crucial to understand the interplay between disease dynamics and human conduct. Various factors can impact the control of an epidemic, including social interventions, adherence to health protocols, mask-wearing, and vaccination. This article presents the development of an innovative hybrid model, known as the Combined Dynamic-Learning Model, that integrates classical recurrent dynamic models with four different learning methods. The model is composed of two approaches: The first approach introduces a traditional dynamic model that focuses on analyzing the impact of vaccination on the occurrence of an epidemic, and the second approach employs various learning methods to forecast the potential outcomes of an epidemic. Furthermore, our numerical results offer an interesting comparison between the traditional approach and modern learning techniques. Our classic dynamic model is a compartmental model that aims to analyze and forecast the diffusion of epidemics. The model we propose has a recurrent structure with piecewise constant parameters and includes compartments for susceptible, exposed, vaccinated, infected, and recovered individuals. This model can accurately mirror the dynamics of infectious diseases, which enables us to evaluate the impact of restrictive measures on the spread of diseases. We conduct a comprehensive dynamic analysis of our model. Additionally, we suggest an optimal numerical design to determine the parameters of the system. Also, we use regression tree learning, bidirectional long short-term memory, gated recurrent unit, and a combined deep learning method for training and evaluation of an epidemic. In the final section of our paper, we apply these methods to recently published data on COVID-19 in Austria, Brazil, and China from 26 February 2021 to 4 August 2021, which is when vaccination efforts began. To evaluate the numerical results, we utilized various metrics such as RMSE and R-squared. Our findings suggest that the dynamic model is ideal for long-term analysis, data fitting, and identifying parameters that impact epidemics. However, it is not as effective as the supervised learning method for making long-term forecasts. On the other hand, supervised learning techniques, compared to dynamic models, are more effective for predicting the spread of diseases, but not for analyzing the behavior of epidemics."
Generative deep learning furthers the understanding of local distributions of fat and muscle on body shape and health using 3D surface scans,other,None,"BACKGROUND: Body shape, an intuitive health indicator, is deterministically driven by body composition. We developed and validated a deep learning model that generates accurate dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans from three-dimensional optical body scans (3DO), enabling compositional analysis of the whole body and specified subregions. Previous works on generative medical imaging models lack quantitative validation and only report quality metrics.
METHODS: Our model was self-supervised pretrained on two large clinical DXA datasets and fine-tuned using the Shape Up! Adults study dataset. Model-predicted scans from a holdout test set were evaluated using clinical commercial DXA software for compositional accuracy.
RESULTS: Predicted DXA scans achieve R2 of 0.73, 0.89, and 0.99 and RMSEs of 5.32, 6.56, and 4.15 kg for total fat mass (FM), fat-free mass (FFM), and total mass, respectively. Custom subregion analysis results in R2s of 0.70-0.89 for left and right thigh composition. We demonstrate the ability of models to produce quantitatively accurate visualizations of soft tissue and bone, confirming a strong relationship between body shape and composition.
CONCLUSIONS: This work highlights the potential of generative models in medical imaging and reinforces the importance of quantitative validation for assessing their clinical utility."
Deep Learning and Likelihood Approaches for Viral Phylogeography Converge on the Same Answers Whether the Inference Model Is Right or Wrong,other,neural network,"Analysis of phylogenetic trees has become an essential tool in epidemiology. Likelihood-based methods fit models to phylogenies to draw inferences about the phylodynamics and history of viral transmission. However, these methods are often computationally expensive, which limits the complexity and realism of phylodynamic models and makes them ill-suited for informing policy decisions in real-time during rapidly developing outbreaks. Likelihood-free methods using deep learning are pushing the boundaries of inference beyond these constraints. In this paper, we extend, compare, and contrast a recently developed deep learning method for likelihood-free inference from trees. We trained multiple deep neural networks using phylogenies from simulated outbreaks that spread among 5 locations and found they achieve close to the same levels of accuracy as Bayesian inference under the true simulation model. We compared robustness to model misspecification of a trained neural network to that of a Bayesian method. We found that both models had comparable performance, converging on similar biases. We also implemented a method of uncertainty quantification called conformalized quantile regression that we demonstrate has similar patterns of sensitivity to model misspecification as Bayesian highest posterior density (HPD) and greatly overlap with HPDs, but have lower precision (more conservative). Finally, we trained and tested a neural network against phylogeographic data from a recent study of the SARS-Cov-2 pandemic in Europe and obtained similar estimates of region-specific epidemiological parameters and the location of the common ancestor in Europe. Along with being as accurate and robust as likelihood-based methods, our trained neural networks are on average over 3 orders of magnitude faster after training. Our results support the notion that neural networks can be trained with simulated data to accurately mimic the good and bad statistical properties of the likelihood functions of generative phylogenetic models."
Utilizing a novel high-resolution malaria dataset for climate-informed predictions with a deep learning transformer model,other,machine learning model,"Climatic factors influence malaria transmission via the effect on the Anopheles vector and Plasmodium parasite. Modelling and understanding the complex effects that climate has on malaria incidence can enable important early warning capabilities. Deep learning applications across fields are proving valuable, however the field of epidemiological forecasting is still in its infancy with a lack of applied deep learning studies for malaria in southern Africa which leverage quality datasets. Using a novel high resolution malaria incidence dataset containing 23 years of daily data from 1998 to 2021, a statistical model and XGBOOST machine learning model were compared to a deep learning Transformer model by assessing the accuracy of their numerical predictions. A novel loss function, used to account for the variable nature of the data yielded performance around + 20% compared to the standard MSE loss. When numerical predictions were converted to alert thresholds to mimic use in a real-world setting, the Transformer's performance of 80% according to AUROC was 20-40% higher than the statistical and XGBOOST models and it had the highest overall accuracy of 98%. The Transformer performed consistently with increased accuracy as more climate variables were used, indicating further potential for this prediction framework to predict malaria incidence at a daily level using climate data for southern Africa."
Deep-learning-based survival prediction of patients with lower limb melanoma,other,neural network,"BACKGROUND: For the purpose to examine lower limb melanoma (LLM) and its long-term survival rate, we used data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) database. To estimate the prognosis of LLM patients and assess its efficacy, we used a powerful deep learning and neural network approach called DeepSurv.
METHODS: We gathered data on those who had an LLM diagnosis between 2000 and 2019 from the SEER database. We divided the people into training and testing cohorts at a 7:3 ratio using a random selection technique. To assess the likelihood that LLM patients would survive, we compared the results of the DeepSurv model with those of the Cox proportional-hazards (CoxPH) model. Calibration curves, the time-dependent area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), and the concordance index (C-index) were all used to assess how accurate the predictions were.
RESULTS: In this study, a total of 26,243 LLM patients were enrolled, with 7873 serving as the testing cohort and 18,370 as the training cohort. Significant correlations with age, gender, AJCC stage, chemotherapy status, surgery status, regional lymph node removal and the survival outcomes of LLM patients were found by the CoxPH model. The CoxPH model's C-index was 0.766, which signifies a good degree of predicted accuracy. Additionally, we created the DeepSurv model using the training cohort data, which had a higher C-index of 0.852. In addition to calculating the 3-, 5-, and 8-year AUC values, the predictive performance of both models was evaluated. The equivalent AUC values for the CoxPH model were 0.795, 0.767, and 0.847, respectively. The DeepSurv model, in comparison, had better AUC values of 0.872, 0.858, and 0.847. In comparison to the CoxPH model, the DeepSurv model demonstrated greater prediction performance for LLM patients, as shown by the AUC values and the calibration curve.
CONCLUSION: We created the DeepSurv model using LLM patient data from the SEER database, which performed better than the CoxPH model in predicting the survival time of LLM patients."
Prediction of multiclass surgical outcomes in glaucoma using multimodal deep learning based on free-text operative notes and structured EHR data,other,"neural network, machine learning model","OBJECTIVE: Surgical outcome prediction is challenging but necessary for postoperative management. Current machine learning models utilize pre- and post-op data, excluding intraoperative information in surgical notes. Current models also usually predict binary outcomes even when surgeries have multiple outcomes that require different postoperative management. This study addresses these gaps by incorporating intraoperative information into multimodal models for multiclass glaucoma surgery outcome prediction.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We developed and evaluated multimodal deep learning models for multiclass glaucoma trabeculectomy surgery outcomes using both structured EHR data and free-text operative notes. We compare those to baseline models that use structured EHR data exclusively, or neural network models that leverage only operative notes.
RESULTS: The multimodal neural network had the highest performance with a macro AUROC of 0.750 and F1 score of 0.583. It outperformed the baseline machine learning model with structured EHR data alone (macro AUROC of 0.712 and F1 score of 0.486). Additionally, the multimodal model achieved the highest recall (0.692) for hypotony surgical failure, while the surgical success group had the highest precision (0.884) and F1 score (0.775).
DISCUSSION: This study shows that operative notes are an important source of predictive information. The multimodal predictive model combining perioperative notes and structured pre- and post-op EHR data outperformed other models. Multiclass surgical outcome prediction can provide valuable insights for clinical decision-making.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results show the potential of deep learning models to enhance clinical decision-making for postoperative management. They can be applied to other specialties to improve surgical outcome predictions."
Determining epitope specificity of T-cell receptors with transformers,other,None,"SUMMARY: T-cell receptors (TCRs) on T cells recognize and bind to epitopes presented by the major histocompatibility complex in case of an infection or cancer. However, the high diversity of TCRs, as well as their unique and complex binding mechanisms underlying epitope recognition, make it difficult to predict the binding between TCRs and epitopes. Here, we present the utility of transformers, a deep learning strategy that incorporates an attention mechanism that learns the informative features, and show that these models pre-trained on a large set of protein sequences outperform current strategies. We compared three pre-trained auto-encoder transformer models (ProtBERT, ProtAlbert, and ProtElectra) and one pre-trained auto-regressive transformer model (ProtXLNet) to predict the binding specificity of TCRs to 25 epitopes from the VDJdb database (human and murine). Two additional modifications were performed to incorporate gene usage of the TCRs in the four transformer models. Of all 12 transformer implementations (four models with three different modifications), a modified version of the ProtXLNet model could predict TCR-epitope pairs with the highest accuracy (weighted F1 score 0.55 simultaneously considering all 25 epitopes). The modification included additional features representing the gene names for the TCRs. We also showed that the basic implementation of transformers outperformed the previously available methods, i.e. TCRGP, TCRdist, and DeepTCR, developed for the same biological problem, especially for the hard-to-classify labels. We show that the proficiency of transformers in attention learning can be made operational in a complex biological setting like TCR binding prediction. Further ingenuity in utilizing the full potential of transformers, either through attention head visualization or introducing additional features, can extend T-cell research avenues.

Transformer-based biomarker prediction from colorectal cancer histology: A large-scale multicentric study,other,"neural network, convolutional neural network","Deep learning (DL) can accelerate the prediction of prognostic biomarkers from routine pathology slides in colorectal cancer (CRC). However, current approaches rely on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and have mostly been validated on small patient cohorts. Here, we develop a new transformer-based pipeline for end-to-end biomarker prediction from pathology slides by combining a pre-trained transformer encoder with a transformer network for patch aggregation. Our transformer-based approach substantially improves the performance, generalizability, data efficiency, and interpretability as compared with current state-of-the-art algorithms. After training and evaluating on a large multicenter cohort of over 13,000 patients from 16 colorectal cancer cohorts, we achieve a sensitivity of 0.99 with a negative predictive value of over 0.99 for prediction of microsatellite instability (MSI) on surgical resection specimens. We demonstrate that resection specimen-only training reaches clinical-grade performance on endoscopic biopsy tissue, solving a long-standing diagnostic problem."
XMR: an explainable multimodal neural network for drug response prediction,other,neural network,"Introduction: Existing large-scale preclinical cancer drug response databases provide us with a great opportunity to identify and predict potentially effective drugs to combat cancers. Deep learning models built on these databases have been developed and applied to tackle the cancer drug-response prediction task. Their prediction has been demonstrated to significantly outperform traditional machine learning methods. However, due to the ""black box"" characteristic, biologically faithful explanations are hardly derived from these deep learning models. Interpretable deep learning models that rely on visible neural networks (VNNs) have been proposed to provide biological justification for the predicted outcomes. However, their performance does not meet the expectation to be applied in clinical practice. Methods: In this paper, we develop an XMR model, an eXplainable Multimodal neural network for drug Response prediction. XMR is a new compact multimodal neural network consisting of two sub-networks: a visible neural network for learning genomic features and a graph neural network (GNN) for learning drugs' structural features. Both sub-networks are integrated into a multimodal fusion layer to model the drug response for the given gene mutations and the drug's molecular structures. Furthermore, a pruning approach is applied to provide better interpretations of the XMR model. We use five pathway hierarchies (cell cycle, DNA repair, diseases, signal transduction, and metabolism), which are obtained from the Reactome Pathway Database, as the architecture of VNN for our XMR model to predict drug responses of triple negative breast cancer. Results: We find that our model outperforms other state-of-the-art interpretable deep learning models in terms of predictive performance. In addition, our model can provide biological insights into explaining drug responses for triple-negative breast cancer. Discussion: Overall, combining both VNN and GNN in a multimodal fusion layer, XMR captures key genomic and molecular features and offers reasonable interpretability in biology, thereby better predicting drug responses in cancer patients. Our model would also benefit personalized cancer therapy in the future."
A deep learning model for accurately predicting cancer-specific survival in patients with primary bone sarcoma of the extremity: a population-based study,other,None,"PURPOSE: Primary bone and joint sarcomas of the long bone are relatively rare neoplasms with poor prognosis. An efficient clinical tool that can accurately predict patient prognosis is not available. The current study aimed to use deep learning algorithms to develop a prediction model for the prognosis of patients with long bone sarcoma.
METHODS: Data of patients with long bone sarcoma in the extremities was collected from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program database from 2004 to 2014. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to select possible prediction features. DeepSurv, a deep learning model, was constructed for predicting cancer-specific survival rates. In addition, the classical cox proportional hazards model was established for comparison. The predictive accuracy of our models was assessed using the C-index, Integrated Brier Score, receiver operating characteristic curve, and calibration curve.
RESULTS: Age, tumor extension, histological grade, tumor size, surgery, and distant metastasis were associated with cancer-specific survival in patients with long bone sarcoma. According to loss function values, our models converged successfully and effectively learned the survival data of the training cohort. Based on the C-index, area under the curve, calibration curve, and Integrated Brier Score, the deep learning model was more accurate and flexible in predicting survival rates than the cox proportional hazards model.
CONCLUSION: A deep learning model for predicting the survival probability of patients with long bone sarcoma was constructed and validated. It is more accurate and flexible in predicting prognosis than the classical CoxPH model."
An innovative ensemble model based on deep learning for predicting COVID-19 infection,other,"neural network, artificial neural network, convolutional neural network","Nowadays, global public health crises are occurring more frequently, and accurate prediction of these diseases can reduce the burden on the healthcare system. Taking COVID-19 as an example, accurate prediction of infection can assist experts in effectively allocating medical resources and diagnosing diseases. Currently, scholars worldwide use single model approaches or epidemiology models more often to predict the outbreak trend of COVID-19, resulting in poor prediction accuracy. Although a few studies have employed ensemble models, there is still room for improvement in their performance. In addition, there are only a few models that use the laboratory results of patients to predict COVID-19 infection. To address these issues, research efforts should focus on improving disease prediction performance and expanding the use of medical disease prediction models. In this paper, we propose an innovative deep learning model Whale Optimization Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) called WOCLSA which incorporates three models ANN, CNN and LSTM. The WOCLSA model utilizes the Whale Optimization Algorithm to optimize the neuron number, dropout and batch size parameters in the integrated model of ANN, CNN and LSTM, thereby finding the global optimal solution parameters. WOCLSA employs 18 patient indicators as predictors, and compares its results with three other ensemble deep learning models. All models were validated with train-test split approaches. We evaluate and compare our proposed model and other models using accuracy, F1 score, recall, AUC and precision metrics. Through many studies and tests, our results show that our prediction models can identify patients with COVID-19 infection at the AUC of 91%, 91%, and 93% respectively. Other prediction results achieve a respectable accuracy of 92.82%, 92.79%, and 91.66% respectively, f1-score of 93.41%, 92.79%, and 92.33% respectively, precision of 93.41%, 92.79%, and 92.33% respectively, recall of 93.41%, 92.79%, and 92.33% respectively. All of these exceed 91%, surpassing those of comparable models. The execution time of WOCLSA is also an advantage. Therefore, the WOCLSA ensemble model can be used to assist in verifying laboratory research results and predict and to judge various diseases in public health events."
Harnessing the power of AI: Advanced deep learning models optimization for accurate SARS-CoV-2 forecasting,other,"neural network, multilayer perceptron, convolutional neural network, recurrent neural network","The pandemic has significantly affected many countries including the USA, UK, Asia, the Middle East and Africa region, and many other countries. Similarly, it has substantially affected Malaysia, making it crucial to develop efficient and precise forecasting tools for guiding public health policies and approaches. Our study is based on advanced deep-learning models to predict the SARS-CoV-2 cases. We evaluate the performance of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Bi-directional LSTM, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), CNN-LSTM, Multilayer Perceptron, Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN). We trained these models and assessed them using a detailed dataset of confirmed cases, demographic data, and pertinent socio-economic factors. Our research aims to determine the most reliable and accurate model for forecasting SARS-CoV-2 cases in the region. We were able to test and optimize deep learning models to predict cases, with each model displaying diverse levels of accuracy and precision. A comprehensive evaluation of the models' performance discloses the most appropriate architecture for Malaysia's specific situation. This study supports ongoing efforts to combat the pandemic by offering valuable insights into the application of sophisticated deep-learning models for precise and timely SARS-CoV-2 case predictions. The findings hold considerable implications for public health decision-making, empowering authorities to create targeted and data-driven interventions to limit the virus's spread and minimize its effects on Malaysia's population."
An intrinsically interpretable neural network architecture for sequence-to-function learning,other,"neural network, convolutional neural network","MOTIVATION: Sequence-based deep learning approaches have been shown to predict a multitude of functional genomic readouts, including regions of open chromatin and RNA expression of genes. However, a major limitation of current methods is that model interpretation relies on computationally demanding post hoc analyses, and even then, one can often not explain the internal mechanics of highly parameterized models. Here, we introduce a deep learning architecture called totally interpretable sequence-to-function model (tiSFM). tiSFM improves upon the performance of standard multilayer convolutional models while using fewer parameters. Additionally, while tiSFM is itself technically a multilayer neural network, internal model parameters are intrinsically interpretable in terms of relevant sequence motifs.
RESULTS: We analyze published open chromatin measurements across hematopoietic lineage cell-types and demonstrate that tiSFM outperforms a state-of-the-art convolutional neural network model custom-tailored to this dataset. We also show that it correctly identifies context-specific activities of transcription factors with known roles in hematopoietic differentiation, including Pax5 and Ebf1 for B-cells, and Rorc for innate lymphoid cells. tiSFM's model parameters have biologically meaningful interpretations, and we show the utility of our approach on a complex task of predicting the change in epigenetic state as a function of developmental transition.
AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The source code, including scripts for the analysis of key findings, can be found at https://github.com/boooooogey/ATAConv, implemented in Python."
County augmented transformer for COVID-19 state hospitalizations prediction,text mining,None,"The prolonged COVID-19 pandemic has tied up significant medical resources, and its management poses a challenge for the public health care decision making. Accurate predictions of the hospitalizations are crucial for the decision makers to make informed decision for the medical resource allocation. This paper proposes a method named County Augmented Transformer (CAT). To generate accurate predictions of four-week-ahead COVID-19 related hospitalizations for every states in the United States. Inspired by the modern deep learning techniques, our method is based on a self-attention model (known as the transformer model) that is actively used in Natural Language Processing. Our transformer based model can capture both short-term and long-term dependencies within the time series while enjoying computational efficiency. Our model is a data based approach that utilizes the publicly available information including the COVID-19 related number of confirmed cases, deaths, hospitalizations data, and the household median income data. Our numerical experiments demonstrate the strength and the usability of our model as a potential tool for assisting the medical resources allocation."
Tailored machine learning for evaluating the long-term diabetes risk in older individuals: findings from the Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing (TILDA),other,neural network,"OBJECTIVES: The prevalence of diabetes has increased globally, leading to a significant disease burden and financial cost. Early prediction is crucial to control its prevalence.
DESIGN: A prospective cohort study.
SETTING: National representative study on Irish.
PARTICIPANTS: 8504 individuals aged 50 years or older were included.
PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Surveys were conducted to collect over 40 000 variables related to social, financial, health, mental and family status. Feature selection was performed using logistic regression. Different machine/deep learning algorithms were trained, including distributed random forest, extremely randomised trees, a generalised linear model with regularisation, a gradient boosting machine and a deep neural network. These algorithms were integrated into a stacked ensemble to generate the best model. The model was tested using various metrics, such as the area under the curve (AUC), log loss, mean per classification error, mean square error (MSE) and root MSE (RMSE). The SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) method was used to interpret the established model.
RESULTS: After 2 years, 105 baseline features were identified as major contributors to diabetes risk, including sex, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and cirrhosis. The best model achieved high accuracy, robustness and discrimination in predicting diabetes risk, with an AUC of 0.854, log loss of 0.187, mean per classification error of 0.267, RMSE of 0.229 and MSE of 0.052 in the independent test set. The model was also shown to be well calibrated. The SHAP algorithm provided insights into the decision-making process of the model.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings could help physicians in the early identification of high-risk patients and implement targeted interventions to reduce diabetes incidence."
Breast cancer risk prediction combining a convolutional neural network-based mammographic evaluation with clinical factors,other,"neural network, convolutional neural network","PURPOSE: Deep learning techniques, including convolutional neural networks (CNN), have the potential to improve breast cancer risk prediction compared to traditional risk models. We assessed whether combining a CNN-based mammographic evaluation with clinical factors in the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium (BCSC) model improved risk prediction.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study among 23,467 women, age 35-74, undergoing screening mammography (2014-2018). We extracted electronic health record (EHR) data on risk factors. We identified 121 women who subsequently developed invasive breast cancer at least 1 year after the baseline mammogram. Mammograms were analyzed with a pixel-wise mammographic evaluation using CNN architecture. We used logistic regression models with breast cancer incidence as the outcome and predictors including clinical factors only (BCSC model) or combined with CNN risk score (hybrid model). We compared model prediction performance via area under the receiver operating characteristics curves (AUCs).
RESULTS: Mean age was 55.9 years (SD, 9.5) with 9.3% non-Hispanic Black and 36% Hispanic. Our hybrid model did not significantly improve risk prediction compared to the BCSC model (AUC of 0.654 vs 0.624, respectively, p = 0.063). In subgroup analyses, the hybrid model outperformed the BCSC model among non-Hispanic Blacks (AUC 0.845 vs. 0.589; p = 0.026) and Hispanics (AUC 0.650 vs 0.595; p = 0.049).
CONCLUSION: We aimed to develop an efficient breast cancer risk assessment method using CNN risk score and clinical factors from the EHR. With future validation in a larger cohort, our CNN model combined with clinical factors may help predict breast cancer risk in a cohort of racially/ethnically diverse women undergoing screening."
Deep multi-modal fusion network with gated unit for breast cancer survival prediction,other,"neural network, convolutional neural network","Accurate survival prediction is a critical goal in the prognosis of breast cancer patients because it can help physicians make more patient-friendly decisions and further guide appropriate treatment. Breast cancer is often caused by genetic abnormalities, which prompts researchers to consider information such as gene expression and copy number variation in addition to clinical data in their studies. The integration of these multi-modal data can improve the predictive power of models. However, with the highly unbalanced information of breast cancer patient data, it becomes a new challenge for breast cancer patient survival prediction to fully extract the characteristic information of these multi-modal data and to consider the complementarity of this information. To this end, we propose a deep multi-modal fusion network (DMMFN) to predict the five-year survival of breast cancer patients by integrating clinical data, copy number variation data, and gene expression data. The imbalanced dataset is first processed using the oversampling method SMOTE-NC. Then the abstract modal features of the multi-modal data are extracted by the two-layer one-dimensional convolutional neural network and the bi-directional long short-term memory network. Next, the weight coefficients of each modal data are dynamically adjusted using gated multimodal units to obtain fusion features. Finally, the fusion features are fed into the MaxoutMLP classifier to obtain the final prediction results. We conducted experiments on the METABRIC dataset to verify the validity of the multi-modal data and compared it with other methods. The comprehensive performance evaluation shows that DMMFN has better prediction performance."
Deep Learning vs Traditional Models for Predicting Hospital Readmission among Patients with Diabetes,other,None,"A hospital readmission risk prediction tool for patients with diabetes based on electronic health record (EHR) data is needed. The optimal modeling approach, however, is unclear. In 2,836,569 encounters of 36,641 diabetes patients, deep learning (DL) long short-term memory (LSTM) models predicting unplanned, all-cause, 30-day readmission were developed and compared to several traditional models. Models used EHR data defined by a Common Data Model. The LSTM model Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUROC) was significantly greater than that of the next best traditional model [LSTM 0.79 vs Random Forest (RF) 0.72, p<0.0001]. Experiments showed that performance of the LSTM models increased as prior encounter number increased up to 30 encounters. An LSTM model with 16 selected laboratory tests yielded equivalent performance to a model with all 981 laboratory tests. This new DL model may provide the basis for a more useful readmission risk prediction tool for diabetes patients."
Development and validation of a deep transfer learning-based multivariable survival model to predict overall survival in lung cancer,other,None,"BACKGROUND: Numerous deep learning-based survival models are being developed for various diseases, but those that incorporate both deep learning and transfer learning are scarce. Deep learning-based models may not perform optimally in real-world populations due to variations in variables and characteristics. Transfer learning, on the other hand, enables a model developed for one domain to be adapted for a related domain. Our objective was to integrate deep learning and transfer learning to create a multivariable survival model for lung cancer.
METHODS: We collected data from 601,480 lung cancer patients in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database and 4,512 lung cancer patients in the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University (GYFY) database. The primary model was trained with the SEER database, internally validated with a dataset from SEER, and externally validated through transfer learning with the GYFY database. The performance of the model was compared with a traditional Cox model by C-indexes. We also explored the model's performance in the setting of missing data and generated the artificial intelligence (AI) certainty of the prediction.
RESULTS: The C-indexes in the training dataset (SEER full sample) with DeepSurv and Cox model were 0.792 (0.791-0.792) and 0.714 (0.713-0.715), respectively. The values were 0.727 (0.704-0.750) and 0.692 (0.666-0.718) after applying the trained model in the test dataset (GYFY). The AI certainty of the DeepSurv model output was from 0.98 to 1. For transfer learning through fine-tuning, the results showed that the test set could achieve a higher C-index (20% vs. 30% fine-tuning data) with more fine-tuning dataset. Besides, the DeepSurv model was more accurate than the traditional Cox model in predicting with missing data, after random data loss of 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, and median fill-in missing values.
CONCLUSIONS: The model outperformed the traditional Cox model, was robust with missing data and provided the AI certainty of prediction. It can be used for patient self-evaluation and risk stratification in clinical trials. Researchers can fine-tune the pre-trained model and integrate their own database to explore other prognostic factors."
Development and validation of a deep learning survival model for cervical adenocarcinoma patients,other,neural network,"BACKGROUND: The aim was to develop a personalized survival prediction deep learning model for cervical adenocarcinoma patients and process personalized survival prediction.
METHODS: A total of 2501 cervical adenocarcinoma patients from the surveillance, epidemiology and end results database and 220 patients from Qilu hospital were enrolled in this study. We created our deep learning (DL) model to manipulate the data and evaluated its performance against four other competitive models. We tried to demonstrate a new grouping system oriented by survival outcomes and process personalized survival prediction by using our DL model.
RESULTS: The DL model reached 0.878 c-index and 0.09 Brier score in the test set, which was better than the other four models. In the external test set, our model achieved a 0.80 c-index and 0.13 Brier score. Thus, we developed prognosis-oriented risk grouping for patients according to risk scores computed by our DL model. Notable differences among groupings were observed. In addition, a personalized survival prediction system based on our risk-scoring grouping was developed.
CONCLUSIONS: We developed a deep neural network model for cervical adenocarcinoma patients. The performance of this model proved to be superior to other models. The results of external validation supported the possibility that the model can be used in clinical work. Finally, our survival grouping and personalized prediction system provided more accurate prognostic information for patients than traditional FIGO stages."
RESEAT: Recurrent Self-Attention Network for Multi-Regional Influenza Forecasting,other,"neural network, recurrent neural network","Early forecasting of influenza is an important task for public health to reduce losses due to influenza. Various deep learning-based models for multi-regional influenza forecasting have been proposed to forecast future influenza occurrences in multiple regions. While they only use historical data for forecasting, temporal and regional patterns need to be jointly considered for better accuracy. Basic deep learning models such as recurrent neural networks and graph neural networks have limited ability to model both patterns together. A more recent approach uses an attention mechanism or its variant, self-attention. Although these mechanisms can model regional interrelationships, in state-of-the-art models, they consider accumulated regional interrelationships based on attention values that are calculated only once for all of the input data. This limitation makes it difficult to effectively model the regional interrelationships that change dynamically during that period. Therefore, in this article, we propose a recurrent self-attention network (RESEAT) for various multi-regional forecasting tasks such as influenza and electrical load forecasting. The model can learn regional interrelationships over the entire period of the input data using self-attention, and it recurrently connects the attention weights using message passing. We demonstrate through extensive experiments that the proposed model outperforms other state-of-the-art forecasting models in terms of the forecasting accuracy for influenza and COVID-19. We also describe how to visualize regional interrelationships and analyze the sensitivity of hyperparameters to forecasting accuracy."
Development and validation of machine learning models to predict survival of patients with resected stage-III NSCLC,other,"neural network, machine learning model","OBJECTIVE: To compare the performance of three machine learning algorithms with the tumor, node, and metastasis (TNM) staging system in survival prediction and validate the individual adjuvant treatment recommendations plan based on the optimal model.
METHODS: In this study, we trained three machine learning madel and validated 3 machine learning survival models-deep learning neural network, random forest and cox proportional hazard model- using the data of patients with stage-al3 NSCLC patients who received resection surgery from the National Cancer Institute Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database from 2012 to 2017,the performance of survival predication from all machine learning models were assessed using a concordance index (c-index) and the averaged c-index is utilized for cross-validation. The optimal model was externally validated in an independent cohort from Shaanxi Provincial People's Hospital. Then we compare the performance of the optimal model and TNM staging system. Finally, we developed a Cloud-based recommendation system for adjuvant therapy to visualize survival curve of each treatment plan and deployed on the internet.
RESULTS: A total of 4617 patients were included in this study. The deep learning network performed more stably and accurately in predicting stage-iii NSCLC resected patients survival than the random survival forest and Cox proportional hazard model on the internal test dataset (C-index=0.834 vs. 0.678 vs. 0.640) and better than TNM staging system (C-index=0.820 vs. 0.650) in the external validation. The individual patient who follow the reference from recommendation system had superior survival compared to those who did not. The predicted 5-year-survival curve for each adjuvant treatment plan could be accessed in the recommender system via the browser.
CONCLUSION: Deep learning model has several advantages over linear model and random forest model in prognostic predication and treatment recommendations. This novel analytical approach may provide accurate predication on individual survival and treatment recommendations for resected Stage-iii NSCLC patients."
An intrinsically interpretable neural network architecture for sequence to function learning,other,"neural network, convolutional neural network","MOTIVATION: Sequence-based deep learning approaches have been shown to predict a multitude of functional genomic readouts, including regions of open chromatin and RNA expression of genes. However, a major limitation of current methods is that model interpretation relies on computationally demanding post hoc analyses, and even then, one can often not explain the internal mechanics of highly parameterized models. Here, we introduce a deep learning architecture called tiSFM (totally interpretable sequence to function model). tiSFM improves upon the performance of standard multi-layer convolutional models while using fewer parameters. Additionally, while tiSFM is itself technically a multi-layer neural network, internal model parameters are intrinsically interpretable in terms of relevant sequence motifs.
RESULTS: We analyze published open chromatin measurements across hematopoietic lineage cell-types and demonstrate that tiSFM outperforms a state-of-the-art convolutional neural network model custom-tailored to this dataset. We also show that it correctly identifies context specific activities of transcription factors with known roles in hematopoietic differentiation, including Pax5 and Ebf1 for B-cells, and Rorc for innate lymphoid cells. tiSFM's model parameters have biologically meaningful interpretations, and we show the utility of our approach on a complex task of predicting the change in epigenetic state as a function of developmental transition.
AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The source code, including scripts for the analysis of key findings, can be found at https://github.com/boooooogey/ATAConv, implemented in Python."
Comparison of State-of-the-Art Neural Network Survival Models with the Pooled Cohort Equations for Cardiovascular Disease Risk Prediction,other,neural network,"BACKGROUND: The Pooled Cohort Equations (PCEs) are race- and sex-specific Cox proportional hazards (PH)-based models used for 10-year atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk prediction with acceptable discrimination. In recent years, neural network models have gained increasing popularity with their success in image recognition and text classification. Various survival neural network models have been proposed by combining survival analysis and neural network architecture to take advantage of the strengths from both. However, the performance of these survival neural network models compared to each other and to PCEs in ASCVD prediction is unknown.
METHODS: In this study, we used 6 cohorts from the Lifetime Risk Pooling Project (with 5 cohorts as training/internal validation and one cohort as external validation) and compared the performance of the PCEs in 10-year ASCVD risk prediction with an all two-way interactions Cox PH model (Cox PH-TWI) and three state-of-the-art neural network survival models including Nnet-survival, Deepsurv, and Cox-nnet. For all the models, we used the same 7 covariates as used in the PCEs. We fitted each of the aforementioned models in white females, white males, black females, and black males, respectively. We evaluated models' internal and external discrimination power and calibration.
RESULTS: The training/internal validation sample comprised 23216 individuals. The average age at baseline was 57.8 years old (SD = 9.6); 16% developed ASCVD during average follow-up of 10.50 (SD = 3.02) years. Based on 10 × 10 cross-validation, the method that had the highest C-statistics was Deepsurv (0.7371) for white males, Deepsurv and Cox PH-TWI (0.7972) for white females, PCE (0.6981) for black males, and Deepsurv (0.7886) for black females. In the external validation dataset, Deepsurv (0.7032), Cox-nnet (0.7282), PCE (0.6811), and Deepsurv (0.7316) had the highest C-statistics for white male, white female, black male, and black female population, respectively. Calibration plots showed that in 10 × 10 validation, all models had good calibration in all race and sex groups. In external validation, all models overestimated the risk for 10-year ASCVD.
CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated the use of the state-of-the-art neural network survival models in ASCVD risk prediction. Neural network survival models had similar if not superior discrimination and calibration compared to PCEs."
Influenza surveillance with Baidu index and attention-based long short-term memory model,other,"neural network, machine learning model, recurrent neural network","BACKGROUND: The prediction and prevention of influenza is a public health issue of great concern, and the study of timely acquisition of influenza transmission trend has become an important research topic. For achieving more quicker and accurate detection and prediction, the data recorded on the Internet, especially on the search engine from Google or Baidu are widely introduced into this field. Moreover, with the development of intelligent technology and machine learning algorithm, many updated and advanced trend tracking and forecasting methods are also being used in this research problem.
METHODS: In this paper, a new recurrent neural network architecture, attention-based long short-term memory model is proposed for influenza surveillance. This is a kind of deep learning model which is trained by processing from Baidu Index series so as to fit the real influenza survey time series. Previous studies on influenza surveillance by Baidu Index mostly used traditional autoregressive moving average model or classical machine learning models such as logarithmic linear regression, support vector regression or multi-layer perception model to fit influenza like illness data, which less considered the deep learning structure. Meanwhile, some new model that considered the deep learning structure did not take into account the application of Baidu index data. This study considers introducing the recurrent neural network with long short-term memory combined with attention mechanism into the influenza surveillance research model, which not only fits the research problems well in model structure, but also provides research methods based on Baidu index.
RESULTS: The actual survey data and Baidu Index data are used to train and test the proposed attention-based long short-term memory model and the other comparison models, so as to iterate the value of the model parameters, and to describe and predict the influenza epidemic situation. The experimental results show that our proposed model has better performance in the mean absolute error, mean absolute percentage error, index of agreement and other indicators than the other comparison models.
CONCLUSION: Our proposed attention-based long short-term memory model vividly verifies the ability of this attention-based long short-term memory structure for better surveillance and prediction the trend of influenza. In comparison with some of the latest models and methods in this research field, the model we proposed is also excellent in effect, even more lightweight and robust. Future research direction can consider fusing multimodal data based on this model and developing more application scenarios."
A Hybrid Model for Coronavirus Disease 2019 Forecasting Based on Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition and Deep Learning,other,None,"The novel coronavirus pneumonia that began to spread in 2019 is still raging and has placed a burden on medical systems and governments in various countries. For policymaking and medical resource decisions, a good prediction model is necessary to monitor and evaluate the trends of the epidemic. We used a long short-term memory (LSTM) model and the improved hybrid model based on ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) to predict COVID-19 trends; Methods: The data were collected from the Harvard Dataverse. Epidemic data from 21 January 2020 to 25 April 2021 for California, the most severely affected state in the United States, were used to develop an LSTM model and an EEMD-LSTM hybrid model, which is an LSTM model combined with ensemble empirical mode decomposition. In this study, ninety percent of the data were adopted to fit the models as a training set, while the subsequent 10% were used to test the prediction effect of the models. The mean absolute percentage error, mean absolute error, and root mean square error were used to evaluate the prediction performances of the models; Results: The results indicated that the number of confirmed cases in California was increasing as of 25 April 2021, with no obvious evidence of a sharp decline. On 25 April 2021, the LSTM model predicted 3666418 confirmed cases, whereas the EEMD-LSTM predicted 3681150. The mean absolute percentage errors for the LSTM and EEMD-LSTM models were 0.0151 and 0.0051, respectively. The mean absolute and root mean square errors were 5.58 × 104 and 5.63 × 104 for the LSTM model and 1.9 × 104 and 2.43 × 104 for the EEMD-LSTM model, respectively; Conclusions: The results showed the advantage of an EEMD-LSTM model over a single LSTM model, and the established EEMD-LSTM model may be suitable for monitoring and evaluating the epidemic situation and providing quantitative analysis evidence for epidemic prevention and control."
Data Assimilation Predictive GAN (DA-PredGAN) Applied to a Spatio-Temporal Compartmental Model in Epidemiology,other,None,"We propose a novel use of generative adversarial networks (GANs) (i) to make predictions in time (PredGAN) and (ii) to assimilate measurements (DA-PredGAN). In the latter case, we take advantage of the natural adjoint-like properties of generative models and the ability to simulate forwards and backwards in time. GANs have received much attention recently, after achieving excellent results for their generation of realistic-looking images. We wish to explore how this property translates to new applications in computational modelling and to exploit the adjoint-like properties for efficient data assimilation. We apply these methods to a compartmental model in epidemiology that is able to model space and time variations, and that mimics the spread of COVID-19 in an idealised town. To do this, the GAN is set within a reduced-order model, which uses a low-dimensional space for the spatial distribution of the simulation states. Then the GAN learns the evolution of the low-dimensional states over time. The results show that the proposed methods can accurately predict the evolution of the high-fidelity numerical simulation, and can efficiently assimilate observed data and determine the corresponding model parameters."
The potential role of machine learning in modelling advanced chronic liver disease,other,"neural network, recurrent neural network","The use of artificial intelligence is rapidly increasing in medicine to support clinical decision making mostly through diagnostic and prediction models. Such models derive from huge databases (big data) including a large variety of health-related individual patient data (input) and the corresponding diagnosis and/or outcome (labels). Various types of algorithms (e.g. neural networks) based on powerful computational ability (machine), allow to detect the relationship between input and labels (learning). More complex algorithms, like recurrent neural network can learn from previous as well as actual input (deep learning) and are used for more complex tasks like imaging analysis and personalized (bespoke) medicine. The prompt availability of big data makes that artificial intelligence can provide rapid answers to questions that would require years of traditional clinical research. It may therefore be a key tool to overcome several major gaps in the model of advanced chronic liver disease, mostly transition from mild to clinically significant portal hypertension, the impact of acute decompensation and the role of further decompensation and treatment efficiency. However, several limitations of artificial intelligence should be overcome before its application in clinical practice. Assessment of the risk of bias, understandability of the black boxes developing the models and models' validation are the most important areas deserving clarification for artificial intelligence to be widely accepted from physicians and patients."
A novel risk classification system based on the eighth edition of TNM frameworks for esophageal adenocarcinoma patients: A deep learning approach,other,neural network,"OBJECTIVE: To develop and validate a deep learning predictive model with better performance in survival estimation of esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC).
METHOD: Cases diagnosed between January 2010 and December 2018 were extracted from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. A deep learning survival neural network was developed and validated based on 17 variables, including demographic information, clinicopathological characteristics, and treatment details. Based on the total risk score derived from this algorithm, a novel risk classification system was constructed and compared with the 8th edition of the tumor, node, and metastasis (TNM) staging system.
RESULTS: Of 7,764 EAC patients eligible for the study, 6,818 (87.8%) were men and the median (interquartile range, IQR) age was 65 (58-72) years. The deep learning model generated significantly superior predictions to the 8th edition staging system on the test data set (C-index: 0.773 [95% CI, 0.757-0.789] vs. 0.683 [95% CI, 0.667-0.699]; P &lt; 0.001). Calibration curves revealed that the deep learning model was well calibrated for 1- and 3-year OS, most points almost directly distributing on the 45° line. Decision curve analyses (DCAs) showed that the novel risk classification system exhibited a more significant positive net benefit than the TNM staging system. A user-friendly and precise web-based calculator with a portably executable file was implemented to visualize the deep learning predictive model.
CONCLUSION: A deep learning predictive model was developed and validated, which possesses more excellent calibration and discrimination abilities in survival prediction of EAC. The novel risk classification system based on the deep learning algorithm may serve as a useful tool in clinical decision making given its easy-to-use and better clinical applicability."
"Comparison of ARIMA model, DNN model and LSTM model in predicting disease burden of occupational pneumoconiosis in Tianjin, China",other,neural network,"BACKGROUND: This study aims to explore appropriate model for predicting the disease burden of pneumoconiosis in Tianjin by comparing the prediction effects of Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model, Deep Neural Networks (DNN) model and multivariate Long Short-Term Memory Neural Network (LSTM) models.
METHODS: Disability adjusted life year (DALY) was used to evaluate the disease burden of occupational pneumoconiosis. ARIMA model, DNN model and multivariate LSTM model were used to establish prediction model. Three performance evaluation metrics including Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) were used to compare the prediction effects of the three models.
RESULTS: From 1990 to 2021, there were 10,694 cases of pneumoconiosis patients in Tianjin, resulting in a total of 112,725.52 person-years of DALY. During this period, the annual DALY showed a fluctuating trend, but it had a strong correlation with the number of pneumoconiosis patients, the average age of onset, the average age of receiving dust and the gross industrial product, and had a significant nonlinear relationship with them. The comparison of prediction results showed that the performance of multivariate LSTM model and DNN model is much better than that of traditional ARIMA model. Compared with the DNN model, the multivariate LSTM model performed better in the training set, showing lower RMES (42.30 vs. 380.96), MAE (29.53 vs. 231.20) and MAPE (1.63% vs. 2.93%), but performed less stable than the DNN on the test set, showing slightly higher RMSE (1309.14 vs. 656.44), MAE (886.98 vs. 594.47) and MAPE (36.86% vs. 22.43%).
CONCLUSION: The machine learning techniques of DNN and LSTM are an innovative method to accurately and efficiently predict the burden of pneumoconiosis with the simplest data. It has great application prospects in the monitoring and early warning system of occupational disease burden."
Deep learning-based diagnostic model for predicting complications after gastrectomy,other,neural network,"BACKGROUND: Gastric cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer deaths, and gastrectomy with lymph node dissection is the mainstay of treatment. Despite clinician efforts and advances in surgical methods, the incidence of complications after gastrectomy remains 10%-20% including fatalities. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on utilization of a deep learning method to build a new artificial intelligence model that could help surgeons diagnose these complications.
METHODS: A neural network was constructed with a total of 4000 variables. Clinical, surgical, and pathological data of patients who underwent radical gastrectomy at our institute were collected to maintain a deep learning model. We optimized the parameters of the neural network to diagnose whether these patients would develop complications after gastrectomy or not.
RESULTS: Seventy percent of the data was used to optimize the neural network parameters, and the rest was used to validate the model. A model that maximized the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) area under the curve (AUC) for validation of the data was extracted. The ROC-AUC, sensitivity, and specificity of the model to diagnose all complications were 0.8 vs 0.7, 81% vs 50%, and 69% vs 75%, for the teaching and validation data, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: A predictive model for postoperative complications after radical gastrectomy was successfully constructed using the deep learning method. This model can help surgeons accurately predict the incidence of complications on postoperative day 3."
Deconstruction of Risk Prediction of Ischemic Cardiovascular and Cerebrovascular Diseases Based on Deep Learning,other,neural network,"Over the years, with the widespread use of computer technology and the dramatic increase in electronic medical data, data-driven approaches to medical data analysis have emerged. However, the analysis of medical data remains challenging due to the mixed nature of the data, the incompleteness of many records, and the high level of noise. This paper proposes an improved neural network DBN-LSTM that combines a deep belief network (DBN) with a long short-term memory (LSTM) network. The subset of feature attributes processed by CFS-EGA is used for training, and the optimal selection test of the number of hidden layers is performed on the upper DBN in the process of training DBN-LSTM. At the same time, the validation set is combined to determine the hyperparameters of the LSTM. Construct the DNN, CNN, and long short-term memory (LSTM) network for comparative analysis with DBN-LSTM. Use the classification method to compare the average of the final results of the two experiments. The results show that the prediction accuracy of DBN-LSTM for cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases reaches 95.61%, which is higher than the three traditional neural networks."
A Hybrid Model Based on Improved Transformer and Graph Convolutional Network for COVID-19 Forecasting,other,None,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread rapidly around the world since 2020, with a significant fatality rate. Until recently, numerous countries were unable to adequately control the pandemic. As a result, COVID-19 trend prediction has become a hot topic in academic circles. Both traditional models and existing deep learning (DL) models have the problem of low prediction accuracy. In this paper, we propose a hybrid model based on an improved Transformer and graph convolution network (GCN) for COVID-19 forecasting. The salient feature of the model in this paper is that rich temporal sequence information is extracted by the multi-head attention mechanism, and then the correlation of temporal sequence information is further aggregated by GCN. In addition, to solve the problem of the high time complexity of the existing Transformer, we use the cosine function to replace the softmax calculation, so that the calculation of query, key and value can be split, and the time complexity is reduced from the original O(N2) to O(N). We only concentrated on three states in the United States, one of which was the most affected, one of which was the least affected, and one intermediate state, in order to make our predictions more meaningful. We use mean absolute percentage error and mean absolute error as evaluation indexes. The experimental results show that the proposed time series model has a better predictive performance than the current DL models and traditional models. Additionally, our model's convergence outperforms that of the current DL models, offering a more precise benchmark for the control of epidemics."
Predicting rare outcomes in abdominal wall reconstruction using image-based deep learning models,other,"neural network, convolutional neural network","BACKGROUND: Deep learning models with imbalanced data sets are a challenge in the fields of artificial intelligence and surgery. The aim of this study was to develop and compare deep learning models that predict rare but devastating postoperative complications after abdominal wall reconstruction.
METHODS: A prospectively maintained institutional database was used to identify abdominal wall reconstruction patients with preoperative computed tomography scans. Conventional deep learning models were developed using an 8-layer convolutional neural network and a 2-class training system (ie, learns negative and positive outcomes). Conventional deep learning models were compared to deep learning models that were developed using a generative adversarial network anomaly framework, which uses image augmentation and anomaly detection. The primary outcomes were receiver operating characteristic values for predicting mesh infection and pulmonary failure.
RESULTS: Computed tomography scans from 510 patients were used with a total of 10,004 images. Mesh infection and pulmonary failure occurred in 3.7% and 5.6% of patients, respectively. The conventional deep learning models were less effective than generative adversarial network anomaly for predicting mesh infection (receiver operating characteristic 0.61 vs 0.73, P < .01) and pulmonary failure (receiver operating characteristic 0.59 vs 0.70, P < .01). Although the conventional deep learning models had higher accuracies/specificities for predicting mesh infection (0.93 vs 0.78, P < .01/.96 vs .78, P < .01) and pulmonary failure (0.88 vs 0.68, P < .01/.92 vs .67, P < .01), they were substantially compromised by decreased model sensitivity (0.25 vs 0.68, P < .01/.27 vs .73, P < .01).
CONCLUSION: Compared to conventional deep learning models, generative adversarial network anomaly deep learning models showed improved performance on imbalanced data sets, predominantly by increasing model sensitivity. Understanding patients who are at risk for rare but devastating postoperative complications can improve risk stratification, resource utilization, and the consent process."
Using ensembles and distillation to optimize the deployment of deep learning models for the classification of electronic cancer pathology reports,other,"neural network, convolutional neural network","OBJECTIVE: We aim to reduce overfitting and model overconfidence by distilling the knowledge of an ensemble of deep learning models into a single model for the classification of cancer pathology reports.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We consider the text classification problem that involves 5 individual tasks. The baseline model consists of a multitask convolutional neural network (MtCNN), and the implemented ensemble (teacher) consists of 1000 MtCNNs. We performed knowledge transfer by training a single model (student) with soft labels derived through the aggregation of ensemble predictions. We evaluate performance based on accuracy and abstention rates by using softmax thresholding.
RESULTS: The student model outperforms the baseline MtCNN in terms of abstention rates and accuracy, thereby allowing the model to be used with a larger volume of documents when deployed. The highest boost was observed for subsite and histology, for which the student model classified an additional 1.81% reports for subsite and 3.33% reports for histology.
DISCUSSION: Ensemble predictions provide a useful strategy for quantifying the uncertainty inherent in labeled data and thereby enable the construction of soft labels with estimated probabilities for multiple classes for a given document. Training models with the derived soft labels reduce model confidence in difficult-to-classify documents, thereby leading to a reduction in the number of highly confident wrong predictions.
CONCLUSIONS: Ensemble model distillation is a simple tool to reduce model overconfidence in problems with extreme class imbalance and noisy datasets. These methods can facilitate the deployment of deep learning models in high-risk domains with low computational resources where minimizing inference time is required."
Comparisons of deep learning and machine learning while using text mining methods to identify suicide attempts of patients with mood disorders,text mining,"neural network, convolutional neural network","BACKGROUND: Suicide attempt is one of the most severe consequences for patients with mood disorders. This study aimed to perform deep learning and machine learning while using text mining to identify patients with suicide attempts and to compare their effectiveness.
METHODS: A total of 13,100 patients with mood disorders were selected. Two traditional text mining methods, logistic regression and Support vector machine (SVM), and one deep learning model (Convolutional neural network, CNN) were adopted to perform overall analysis and gender-specific subgroup analysis of patients to identify suicide attempts. The classification effectiveness of these models was evaluated by accuracy, F1-value, precision, recall, and the area under Receiver operator characteristic curve (ROC).
RESULTS: CNN's results were greater than the other two for all indicators except recall which was slightly smaller than SVM in male subgroup analysis. The accuracy values of the CNN were 98.4 %, 98.2 %, and 98.5 % in the overall analysis and the subgroup analysis for males and females, respectively. The results of McNemar's test showed that CNN and SVM models' predictions were statistically different from the logistic regression model's predictions in the overall analysis and the subgroup analysis for females (P < 0.050).
LIMITATIONS: A fixed number of features were selected based on document frequency to train models; this was a single-site study.
CONCLUSIONS: CNN model was a better way to detect suicide attempts in patients with mood disorders prior to hospital admission, saving time and resources in recognizing high-risk patients and preventing suicide."
Quality assurance for automatically generated contours with additional deep learning,other,None,"OBJECTIVE: Deploying an automatic segmentation model in practice should require rigorous quality assurance (QA) and continuous monitoring of the model's use and performance, particularly in high-stakes scenarios such as healthcare. Currently, however, tools to assist with QA for such models are not available to AI researchers. In this work, we build a deep learning model that estimates the quality of automatically generated contours.
METHODS: The model was trained to predict the segmentation quality by outputting an estimate of the Dice similarity coefficient given an image contour pair as input. Our dataset contained 60 axial T2-weighted MRI images of prostates with ground truth segmentations along with 80 automatically generated segmentation masks. The model we used was a 3D version of the EfficientDet architecture with a custom regression head. For validation, we used a fivefold cross-validation. To counteract the limitation of the small dataset, we used an extensive data augmentation scheme capable of producing virtually infinite training samples from a single ground truth label mask. In addition, we compared the results against a baseline model that only uses clinical variables for its predictions.
RESULTS: Our model achieved a mean absolute error of 0.020 ± 0.026 (2.2% mean percentage error) in estimating the Dice score, with a rank correlation of 0.42. Furthermore, the model managed to correctly identify incorrect segmentations (defined in terms of acceptable/unacceptable) 99.6% of the time.
CONCLUSION: We believe that the trained model can be used alongside automatic segmentation tools to ensure quality and thus allow intervention to prevent undesired segmentation behavior."
Enhanced Gravitational Search Optimization with Hybrid Deep Learning Model for COVID-19 Diagnosis on Epidemiology Data,other,"neural network, convolutional neural network","Effective screening provides efficient and quick diagnoses of COVID-19 and could alleviate related problems in the health care system. A prediction model that combines multiple features to assess contamination risks was established in the hope of supporting healthcare workers worldwide in triaging patients, particularly in situations with limited health care resources. Furthermore, a lack of diagnosis kits and asymptomatic cases can lead to missed or delayed diagnoses, exposing visitors, medical staff, and patients to 2019-nCoV contamination. Non-clinical techniques including data mining, expert systems, machine learning, and other artificial intelligence technologies have a crucial role to play in containment and diagnosis in the COVID-19 outbreak. This study developed Enhanced Gravitational Search Optimization with a Hybrid Deep Learning Model (EGSO-HDLM) for COVID-19 diagnoses using epidemiology data. The major aim of designing the EGSO-HDLM model was the identification and classification of COVID-19 using epidemiology data. In order to examine the epidemiology data, the EGSO-HDLM model employed a hybrid convolutional neural network with a gated recurrent unit based fusion (HCNN-GRUF) model. In addition, the hyperparameter optimization of the HCNN-GRUF model was improved by the use of the EGSO algorithm, which was derived by including the concepts of cat map and the traditional GSO algorithm. The design of the EGSO algorithm helps in reducing the ergodic problem, avoiding premature convergence, and enhancing algorithm efficiency. To demonstrate the better performance of the EGSO-HDLM model, experimental validation on a benchmark dataset was performed. The simulation results ensured the enhanced performance of the EGSO-HDLM model over recent approaches."
Deep learning imaging features derived from kidney ultrasounds predict chronic kidney disease progression in children with posterior urethral valves,other,None,"BACKGROUND: We sought to use deep learning to extract anatomic features from postnatal kidney ultrasounds and evaluate their performance in predicting the risk and timing of chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression for boys with posterior urethral valves (PUV). We hypothesized that these features would predict CKD progression better than clinical characteristics such as nadir creatinine alone.
METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study of boys with PUV treated at two pediatric health systems from 1990 to 2021. Features of kidneys were extracted from initial postnatal kidney ultrasound images using a deep learning model. Three time-to-event prediction models were built using random survival forests. The Imaging Model included deep learning imaging features, the Clinical Model included clinical data, and the Ensemble Model combined imaging features and clinical data. Separate models were built to include time-dependent clinical data that were available at 6 months, 1 year, 3 years, and 5 years.
RESULTS: Two-hundred and twenty-five patients were included in the analysis. All models performed well with C-indices of 0.7 or greater. The Clinical Model outperformed the Imaging Model at all time points with nadir creatinine driving the performance of the Clinical Model. Combining the 6-month Imaging Model (C-index 0.7; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.6, 0.79) with the 6-month Clinical Model (C-index 0.79; 95% CI 0.71, 0.86) resulted in a 6-month Ensemble Model that performed better (C-index 0.82; 95% CI 0.77, 0.88) than either model alone.
CONCLUSIONS: Deep learning imaging features extracted from initial postnatal kidney ultrasounds may improve early prediction of CKD progression among children with PUV. A higher resolution version of the Graphical abstract is available as Supplementary information."
Deep Spatiotemporal Model for COVID-19 Forecasting,other,"neural network, machine learning model, convolutional neural network, recurrent neural network","COVID-19 has caused millions of infections and deaths over the last 2 years. Machine learning models have been proposed as an alternative to conventional epidemiologic models in an effort to optimize short- and medium-term forecasts that will help health authorities to optimize the use of policies and resources to tackle the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Although previous machine learning models based on time pattern analysis for COVID-19 sensed data have shown promising results, the spread of the virus has both spatial and temporal components. This manuscript proposes a new deep learning model that combines a time pattern extraction based on the use of a Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) over a preceding spatial analysis based on a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) applied to a sequence of COVID-19 incidence images. The model has been validated with data from the 286 health primary care centers in the Comunidad de Madrid (Madrid region, Spain). The results show improved scores in terms of both root mean square error (RMSE) and explained variance (EV) when compared with previous models that have mainly focused on the temporal patterns and dependencies."
A multi-task Gaussian process self-attention neural network for real-time prediction of the need for mechanical ventilators in COVID-19 patients,other,"neural network, machine learning model","OBJECTIVE: The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has overwhelmed the capacity of healthcare resources and posed a challenge for worldwide hospitals. The ability to distinguish potentially deteriorating patients from the rest helps facilitate reasonable allocation of medical resources, such as ventilators, hospital beds, and human resources. The real-time accurate prediction of a patient's risk scores could also help physicians to provide earlier respiratory support for the patient and reduce the risk of mortality.
METHODS: We propose a robust real-time prediction model for the in-hospital COVID-19 patients' probability of requiring mechanical ventilation (MV). The end-to-end neural network model incorporates the Multi-task Gaussian Process to handle the irregular sampling rate in observational data together with a self-attention neural network for the prediction task.
RESULTS: We evaluate our model on a large database with 9,532 nationwide in-hospital patients with COVID-19. The model demonstrates significant robustness and consistency improvements compared to conventional machine learning models. The proposed prediction model also shows performance improvements in terms of area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) compared to various deep learning models, especially at early times after a patient's hospital admission.
CONCLUSION: The availability of large and real-time clinical data calls for new methods to make the best use of them for real-time patient risk prediction. It is not ideal for simplifying the data for traditional methods or for making unrealistic assumptions that deviate from observation's true dynamics. We demonstrate a pilot effort to harmonize cross-sectional and longitudinal information for mechanical ventilation needing prediction."
Deep learning time series prediction models in surveillance data of hepatitis incidence in China,other,"neural network, recurrent neural network","BACKGROUND: Precise incidence prediction of Hepatitis infectious disease is critical for early prevention and better government strategic planning. In this paper, we presented different prediction models using deep learning methods based on the monthly incidence of Hepatitis through a national public health surveillance system in China mainland.
METHODS: We assessed and compared the performance of three deep learning methods, namely, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) prediction model, Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) prediction model, and Back Propagation Neural Network (BPNN) prediction model. The data collected from 2005 to 2018 were used for the training and prediction model, while the data are split via 5-Fold cross-validation. The performance was evaluated based on three metrics: mean square error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE).
RESULTS: Among the year 2005-2018, 20,924,951 cases and 11,892 deaths were supervised in the system. Hepatitis B (HB) is the most disease-causing incidence and death, and the proportion is greater than 70 percent, while the percentage of the incidence and deaths is decreased much in 2018 compared with 2005. Based on the measured errors and the visualization of the three neural networks, there is no one model predicting the incidence cases that can be completely superior to other models. When predicting the number of incidence cases for HB, the performance ranking of the three models from high to low is LSTM, BPNN, RNN, while it is LSTM, RNN, BPNN for Hepatitis C (HC). while the MAE, MSE and MAPE of the LSTM model for HB, HC are 3.84*10-06, 3.08*10-11, 4.981, 8.84*10-06, 1.98*10-12,5.8519, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: The deep learning time series predictive models show their significance to forecast the Hepatitis incidence and have the potential to assist the decision-makers in making efficient decisions for the early detection of the disease incidents, which would significantly promote Hepatitis disease control and management."
Neural Translation and Automated Recognition of ICD-10 Medical Entities From Natural Language: Model Development and Performance Assessment,text mining,"neural network, artificial neural network","BACKGROUND: The recognition of medical entities from natural language is a ubiquitous problem in the medical field, with applications ranging from medical coding to the analysis of electronic health data for public health. It is, however, a complex task usually requiring human expert intervention, thus making it expansive and time-consuming. Recent advances in artificial intelligence, specifically the rise of deep learning methods, have enabled computers to make efficient decisions on a number of complex problems, with the notable example of neural sequence models and their powerful applications in natural language processing. However, they require a considerable amount of data to learn from, which is typically their main limiting factor. The Centre for Epidemiology on Medical Causes of Death (CépiDc) stores an exhaustive database of death certificates at the French national scale, amounting to several millions of natural language examples provided with their associated human-coded medical entities available to the machine learning practitioner.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this paper was to investigate the application of deep neural sequence models to the problem of medical entity recognition from natural language.
METHODS: The investigated data set included every French death certificate from 2011 to 2016. These certificates contain information such as the subject's age, the subject's gender, and the chain of events leading to his or her death, both in French and encoded as International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) medical entities, for a total of around 3 million observations in the data set. The task of automatically recognizing ICD-10 medical entities from the French natural language-based chain of events leading to death was then formulated as a type of predictive modeling problem known as a sequence-to-sequence modeling problem. A deep neural network-based model, known as the Transformer, was then slightly adapted and fit to the data set. Its performance was then assessed on an external data set and compared to the current state-of-the-art approach. CIs for derived measurements were estimated via bootstrapping.
RESULTS: The proposed approach resulted in an F-measure value of 0.952 (95% CI 0.946-0.957), which constitutes a significant improvement over the current state-of-the-art approach and its previously reported F-measure value of 0.825 as assessed on a comparable data set. Such an improvement makes possible a whole field of new applications, from nosologist-level automated coding to temporal harmonization of death statistics.
CONCLUSIONS: This paper shows that a deep artificial neural network can directly learn from voluminous data sets in order to identify complex relationships between natural language and medical entities, without any explicit prior knowledge. Although not entirely free from mistakes, the derived model constitutes a powerful tool for automated coding of medical entities from medical language with promising potential applications."
A Broad Learning System to Predict the 28-Day Mortality of Patients Hospitalized with Community-Acquired Pneumonia: A Case-Control Study,other,"neural network, convolutional neural network","This study was to conduct a model based on the broad learning system (BLS) for predicting the 28-day mortality of patients hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). A total of 1,210 eligible CAP cases from Chifeng Municipal Hospital were finally included in this retrospective case-control study. Random forest (RF) and an eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) models were used to develop the prediction models. The data features extracted from BLS are utilized in RF and XGB models to predict the 28-day mortality of CAP patients, which established two integrated models BLS-RF and BLS-XGB. Our results showed the integrated model BLS-XGB as an efficient broad learning system (BLS) for predicting the death risk of patients, which not only performed better than the two basic models but also performed better than the integrated model BLS-RF and two well-known deep learning systems-deep neural network (DNN) and convolutional neural network (CNN). In conclusion, BLS-XGB may be recommended as an efficient model for predicting the 28-day mortality of CAP patients after hospital admission."
Deep Learning to Predict Traumatic Brain Injury Outcomes in the Low-Resource Setting,other,neural network,"OBJECTIVE: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) disproportionately affects low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). In these settings, accurate patient prognostication is both difficult and essential for high-quality patient care. With the ultimate goal of enhancing TBI triage in LMICs, we aim to develop the first deep learning model to predict outcomes after TBI and compare its performance with that of less complex algorithms.
METHODS: TBI patients' data were prospectively collected in Kampala, Uganda, from 2016 to 2020. To predict good versus poor outcome at hospital discharge, we created deep neural network, shallow neural network, and elastic-net regularized logistic regression models. Predictors included 13 easily acquirable clinical variables. We assessed model performance with 5-fold cross-validation to calculate areas under both the receiver operating characteristic curve and precision-recall curve (AUPRC), in addition to standardized partial AUPRC to focus on comparisons at clinically relevant operating points.
RESULTS: We included 2164 patients for model training, of which 12% had poor outcomes. The deep neural network performed best as measured by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (0.941) and standardized partial AUPRC in region maximizing recall (0.291), whereas the shallow neural network was best by the area under the precision-recall curve (0.770). In several other comparisons, the elastic-net regularized logistic regression was noninferior to the neural networks.
CONCLUSIONS: We present the first use of deep learning for TBI prognostication, with an emphasis on LMICs, where there is great need for decision support to allocate limited resources. Optimal algorithm selection depends on the specific clinical setting; deep learning is not a panacea, though it may have a role in these efforts."
"Deep-learning model for predicting the survival of rectal adenocarcinoma patients based on a surveillance, epidemiology, and end results analysis",other,neural network,"BACKGROUND: We collected information on patients with rectal adenocarcinoma in the United States from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and EndResults (SEER) database. We used this information to establish a model that combined deep learning with a multilayer neural network (the DeepSurv model) for predicting the survival rate of patients with rectal adenocarcinoma.
METHODS: We collected patients with rectal adenocarcinoma in the United States and older than 20 yearswho had been added to the SEER database from 2004 to 2015. We divided these patients into training and test cohortsat a ratio of 7:3. The training cohort was used to develop a seven-layer neural network based on the analysis method established by Katzman and colleagues to construct a DeepSurv prediction model. We then used the C-index and calibration plots to evaluate the prediction performance of the DeepSurv model.
RESULTS: The 49,275 patients with rectal adenocarcinoma included in the study were randomly divided into the training cohort (70%, n = 34,492) and the test cohort (30%, n = 14,783). There were no statistically significant differences in clinical characteristics between the two cohorts (p > 0.05). We applied Cox proportional-hazards regression to the data in the training cohort, which showed that age, sex, marital status, tumor grade, surgery status, and chemotherapy status were significant factors influencing survival (p < 0.05). Using the training cohort to construct the DeepSurv model resulted in a C-index of the model of 0.824, while using the test cohort to verify the DeepSurv model yielded a C-index of 0.821. Thesevalues show that the prediction effect of the DeepSurv model for the test-cohort patients was highly consistent with the prediction resultsfor the training-cohort patients.
CONCLUSION: The DeepSurv prediction model of the seven-layer neural network that we have established can accurately predict the survival rateand time of rectal adenocarcinoma patients."
Proposing a novel deep network for detecting COVID-19 based on chest images,other,neural network,"The rapid outbreak of coronavirus threatens humans' life all around the world. Due to the insufficient diagnostic infrastructures, developing an accurate, efficient, inexpensive, and quick diagnostic tool is of great importance. To date, researchers have proposed several detection models based on chest imaging analysis, primarily based on deep neural networks; however, none of which could achieve a reliable and highly sensitive performance yet. Therefore, the nature of this study is primary epidemiological research that aims to overcome the limitations mentioned above by proposing a large-scale publicly available dataset of chest computed tomography scan (CT-scan) images consisting of more than 13k samples. Secondly, we propose a more sensitive deep neural networks model for CT-scan images of the lungs, providing a pixel-wise attention layer on top of the high-level features extracted from the network. Moreover, the proposed model is extended through a transfer learning approach for being applicable in the case of chest X-Ray (CXR) images. The proposed model and its extension have been trained and evaluated through several experiments. The inclusion criteria were patients with suspected PE and positive real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for SARS-CoV-2. The exclusion criteria were negative or inconclusive RT-PCR and other chest CT indications. Our model achieves an AUC score of 0.886, significantly better than its closest competitor, whose AUC is 0.843. Moreover, the obtained results on another commonly-used benchmark show an AUC of 0.899, outperforming related models. Additionally, the sensitivity of our model is 0.858, while that of its closest competitor is 0.81, explaining the efficiency of pixel-wise attention strategy in detecting coronavirus. Our promising results and the efficiency of the models imply that the proposed models can be considered reliable tools for assisting doctors in detecting coronavirus."
Deep learning via LSTM models for COVID-19 infection forecasting in India,other,"neural network, recurrent neural network","The COVID-19 pandemic continues to have major impact to health and medical infrastructure, economy, and agriculture. Prominent computational and mathematical models have been unreliable due to the complexity of the spread of infections. Moreover, lack of data collection and reporting makes modelling attempts difficult and unreliable. Hence, we need to re-look at the situation with reliable data sources and innovative forecasting models. Deep learning models such as recurrent neural networks are well suited for modelling spatiotemporal sequences. In this paper, we apply recurrent neural networks such as long short term memory (LSTM), bidirectional LSTM, and encoder-decoder LSTM models for multi-step (short-term) COVID-19 infection forecasting. We select Indian states with COVID-19 hotpots and capture the first (2020) and second (2021) wave of infections and provide two months ahead forecast. Our model predicts that the likelihood of another wave of infections in October and November 2021 is low; however, the authorities need to be vigilant given emerging variants of the virus. The accuracy of the predictions motivate the application of the method in other countries and regions. Nevertheless, the challenges in modelling remain due to the reliability of data and difficulties in capturing factors such as population density, logistics, and social aspects such as culture and lifestyle."
Development of Deep Learning Models for Predicting In-Hospital Mortality Using an Administrative Claims Database: Retrospective Cohort Study,other,neural network,"BACKGROUND: Administrative claims databases have been used widely in studies because they have large sample sizes and are easily available. However, studies using administrative databases lack information on disease severity, so a risk adjustment method needs to be developed.
OBJECTIVE: We aimed to develop and validate deep learning-based prediction models for in-hospital mortality of acute care patients.
METHODS: The main model was developed using only administrative claims data (age, sex, diagnoses, and procedures on the day of admission). We also constructed disease-specific models for acute myocardial infarction, heart failure, stroke, and pneumonia using common severity indices for these diseases. Using the Japanese Diagnosis Procedure Combination data from July 2010 to March 2017, we identified 46,665,933 inpatients and divided them into derivation and validation cohorts in a ratio of 95:5. The main model was developed using a 9-layer deep neural network with 4 hidden dense layers that had 1000 nodes and were fully connected to adjacent layers. We evaluated model discrimination ability by an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and calibration ability by calibration plot.
RESULTS: Among the eligible patients, 2,005,035 (4.3%) died. Discrimination and calibration of the models were satisfactory. The AUC of the main model in the validation cohort was 0.954 (95% CI 0.954-0.955). The main model had higher discrimination ability than the disease-specific models.
CONCLUSIONS: Our deep learning-based model using diagnoses and procedures produced valid predictions of in-hospital mortality."
Deep-Learning-Based Survival Prediction of Patients in Coronary Care Units,other,None,"BACKGROUND: A survival prediction model based on deep learning has higher accuracy than the CPH model in predicting the survival of CCU patients, and it also has a better discrimination ability. We collected information on patients with various diseases in coronary care units (CCUs) from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) database. The purpose of this study was to use this information to construct a neural-network model based on deep learning to predict the survival probabilities of patients with conditions that are common in CCUs.
METHOD: We collected information on patients in the United States with five common diseases in CCUs from 2001 to 2012. We randomly divided the patients into a training cohort and a testing cohort at a ratio of 7 : 3 and applied a survival prediction method based on deep learning to predict their survival probability. We compared our model with the Cox proportional-hazards regression (CPH) model and used the concordance indexes (C-indexes), receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, and calibration plots to evaluate the predictive performance of the model.
RESULTS: The 3,388 CCU patients included in the study were randomly divided into 2,371 in the training cohort and 1,017 in the testing cohort. The stepwise regression results showed that the important factors affecting patient survival were the type of disease, age, race, anion gap, glucose, neutrophils, white blood cells, potassium, creatine kinase, and blood urea nitrogen (P &lt; 0.05). We used the training cohort to construct a deep-learning model, for which the C-index was 0.833, or about 5% higher than that for the CPH model (0.786). The C-index of the deep-learning model for the test cohort was 0.822, which was also higher than that for the CPH model (0.782). The areas under the ROC curve for the 28-day, 90-day, and 1-year survival probabilities were 0.875, 0.865, and 0.874, respectively, in the deep-learning model, respectively, and 0.830, 0.843, and 0.806 in the CPH model. These values indicate that the survival analysis model based on deep learning is better than the traditional CPH model in predicting the survival of CCU patients.
CONCLUSION: A survival prediction model based on deep learning has higher accuracy than the CPH model in predicting the survival of CCU patients, and it also has a better discrimination ability."
Novel Prediction Model for COVID-19 in Saudi Arabia Based on an LSTM Algorithm,other,neural network,"The rapid emergence of the novel SARS-CoV-2 poses a challenge and has attracted worldwide attention. Artificial intelligence (AI) can be used to combat this pandemic and control the spread of the virus. In particular, deep learning-based time-series techniques are used to predict worldwide COVID-19 cases for short-term and medium-term dependencies using adaptive learning. This study aimed to predict daily COVID-19 cases and investigate the critical factors that increase the transmission rate of this outbreak by examining different influential factors. Furthermore, the study analyzed the effectiveness of COVID-19 prevention measures. A fully connected deep neural network, long short-term memory (LSTM), and transformer model were used as the AI models for the prediction of new COVID-19 cases. Initially, data preprocessing and feature extraction were performed using COVID-19 datasets from Saudi Arabia. The performance metrics for all models were computed, and the results were subjected to comparative analysis to detect the most reliable model. Additionally, statistical hypothesis analysis and correlation analysis were performed on the COVID-19 datasets by including features such as daily mobility, total cases, people fully vaccinated per hundred, weekly hospital admissions per million, intensive care unit patients, and new deaths per million. The results show that the LSTM algorithm had the highest accuracy of all the algorithms and an error of less than 2%. The findings of this study contribute to our understanding of COVID-19 containment. This study also provides insights into the prevention of future outbreaks."
"Artificial intelligence, machine learning, and deep learning for clinical outcome prediction",other,"neural network, recurrent neural network","AI is a broad concept, grouping initiatives that use a computer to perform tasks that would usually require a human to complete. AI methods are well suited to predict clinical outcomes. In practice, AI methods can be thought of as functions that learn the outcomes accompanying standardized input data to produce accurate outcome predictions when trialed with new data. Current methods for cleaning, creating, accessing, extracting, augmenting, and representing data for training AI clinical prediction models are well defined. The use of AI to predict clinical outcomes is a dynamic and rapidly evolving arena, with new methods and applications emerging. Extraction or accession of electronic health care records and combining these with patient genetic data is an area of present attention, with tremendous potential for future growth. Machine learning approaches, including decision tree methods of Random Forest and XGBoost, and deep learning techniques including deep multi-layer and recurrent neural networks, afford unique capabilities to accurately create predictions from high dimensional, multimodal data. Furthermore, AI methods are increasing our ability to accurately predict clinical outcomes that previously were difficult to model, including time-dependent and multi-class outcomes. Barriers to robust AI-based clinical outcome model deployment include changing AI product development interfaces, the specificity of regulation requirements, and limitations in ensuring model interpretability, generalizability, and adaptability over time."
Class imbalance in out-of-distribution datasets: Improving the robustness of the TextCNN for the classification of rare cancer types,text mining,"neural network, machine learning model, convolutional neural network","In the last decade, the widespread adoption of electronic health record documentation has created huge opportunities for information mining. Natural language processing (NLP) techniques using machine and deep learning are becoming increasingly widespread for information extraction tasks from unstructured clinical notes. Disparities in performance when deploying machine learning models in the real world have recently received considerable attention. In the clinical NLP domain, the robustness of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for classifying cancer pathology reports under natural distribution shifts remains understudied. In this research, we aim to quantify and improve the performance of the CNN for text classification on out-of-distribution (OOD) datasets resulting from the natural evolution of clinical text in pathology reports. We identified class imbalance due to different prevalence of cancer types as one of the sources of performance drop and analyzed the impact of previous methods for addressing class imbalance when deploying models in real-world domains. Our results show that our novel class-specialized ensemble technique outperforms other methods for the classification of rare cancer types in terms of macro F1 scores. We also found that traditional ensemble methods perform better in top classes, leading to higher micro F1 scores. Based on our findings, we formulate a series of recommendations for other ML practitioners on how to build robust models with extremely imbalanced datasets in biomedical NLP applications."
National Holidays and Social Mobility Behaviors: Alternatives for Forecasting COVID-19 Deaths in Brazil,other,None,"In this paper, we investigate the influence of holidays and community mobility on the transmission rate and death count of COVID-19 in Brazil. We identify national holidays and hallmark holidays to assess their effect on disease reports of confirmed cases and deaths. First, we use a one-variate model with the number of infected people as input data to forecast the number of deaths. This simple model is compared with a more robust deep learning multi-variate model that uses mobility and transmission rates (R0, Re) from a SEIRD model as input data. A principal components model of community mobility, generated by the principal component analysis (PCA) method, is added to improve the input features for the multi-variate model. The deep learning model architecture is an LSTM stacked layer combined with a dense layer to regress daily deaths caused by COVID-19. The multi-variate model incremented with engineered input features can enhance the forecast performance by up to 18.99% compared to the standard one-variate data-driven model."
Spatio-temporal prediction of the COVID-19 pandemic in US counties: modeling with a deep LSTM neural network,other,"neural network, recurrent neural network","Prediction of complex epidemiological systems such as COVID-19 is challenging on many grounds. Commonly used compartmental models struggle to handle an epidemiological process that evolves rapidly and is spatially heterogeneous. On the other hand, machine learning methods are limited at the beginning of the pandemics due to small data size for training. We propose a deep learning approach to predict future COVID-19 infection cases and deaths 1 to 4 weeks ahead at the fine granularity of US counties. The multi-variate Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network is trained on multiple time series samples at the same time, including a mobility series. Results show that adding mobility as a variable and using multiple samples to train the network improve predictive performance both in terms of bias and of variance of the forecasts. We also show that the predicted results have similar accuracy and spatial patterns with a standard ensemble model used as benchmark. The model is attractive in many respects, including the fine geographic granularity of predictions and great predictive performance several weeks ahead. Furthermore, data requirement and computational intensity are reduced by substituting a single model to multiple models folded in an ensemble model."
Predictive value of a novel Asian lung cancer screening nomogram based on artificial intelligence and epidemiological characteristics,other,"neural network, convolutional neural network","BACKGROUND: To develop and validate a risk prediction nomogram based on a deep learning convolutional neural networks (CNN) model and epidemiological characteristics for lung cancer screening in patients with small pulmonary nodules (SPN).
METHODS: This study included three data sets. First, a CNN model was developed and tested on data set 1. Then, a hybrid prediction model was developed on data set 2 by multivariable binary logistic regression analysis. We combined the CNN model score and the selected epidemiological risk factors, and a risk prediction nomogram was presented. An independent multicenter cohort was used for model external validation. The performance of the nomogram was assessed with respect to its calibration and discrimination.
RESULTS: The final hybrid model included the CNN model score and the screened risk factors included age, gender, smoking status and family history of cancer. The nomogram showed good discrimination and calibration with an area under the curve (AUC) of 91.6% (95% CI: 89.4%-93.5%), compare with the CNN model, the improvement was significance. The performance of the nomogram still showed good discrimination and good calibration in the multicenter validation cohort, with an AUC of 88.3% (95% CI: 83.1%-92.3%).
CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed that epidemiological characteristics should be considered in lung cancer screening, which can significantly improve the efficiency of the artificial intelligence (AI) model alone. We combined the CNN model score with Asian lung cancer epidemiological characteristics to develop a new nomogram to facilitate and accurately perform individualized lung cancer screening, especially for Asians."
Prediction of pandemic risk for animal-origin coronavirus using a deep learning method,other,None,"BACKGROUND: Coronaviruses can be isolated from bats, civets, pangolins, birds and other wild animals. As an animal-origin pathogen, coronavirus can cross species barrier and cause pandemic in humans. In this study, a deep learning model for early prediction of pandemic risk was proposed based on the sequences of viral genomes.
METHODS: A total of 3257 genomes were downloaded from the Coronavirus Genome Resource Library. We present a deep learning model of cross-species coronavirus infection that combines a bidirectional gated recurrent unit network with a one-dimensional convolution. The genome sequence of animal-origin coronavirus was directly input to extract features and predict pandemic risk. The best performances were explored with the use of pre-trained DNA vector and attention mechanism. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and the area under precision-recall curve (AUPR) were used to evaluate the predictive models.
RESULTS: The six specific models achieved good performances for the corresponding virus groups (1 for AUROC and 1 for AUPR). The general model with pre-training vector and attention mechanism provided excellent predictions for all virus groups (1 for AUROC and 1 for AUPR) while those without pre-training vector or attention mechanism had obviously reduction of performance (about 5-25%). Re-training experiments showed that the general model has good capabilities of transfer learning (average for six groups: 0.968 for AUROC and 0.942 for AUPR) and should give reasonable prediction for potential pathogen of next pandemic. The artificial negative data with the replacement of the coding region of the spike protein were also predicted correctly (100% accuracy). With the application of the Python programming language, an easy-to-use tool was created to implements our predictor.
CONCLUSIONS: Robust deep learning model with pre-training vector and attention mechanism mastered the features from the whole genomes of animal-origin coronaviruses and could predict the risk of cross-species infection for early warning of next pandemic."
Exploring deep neural networks via layer-peeled model: Minority collapse in imbalanced training,other,neural network,"In this paper, we introduce the Layer-Peeled Model, a nonconvex, yet analytically tractable, optimization program, in a quest to better understand deep neural networks that are trained for a sufficiently long time. As the name suggests, this model is derived by isolating the topmost layer from the remainder of the neural network, followed by imposing certain constraints separately on the two parts of the network. We demonstrate that the Layer-Peeled Model, albeit simple, inherits many characteristics of well-trained neural networks, thereby offering an effective tool for explaining and predicting common empirical patterns of deep-learning training. First, when working on class-balanced datasets, we prove that any solution to this model forms a simplex equiangular tight frame, which, in part, explains the recently discovered phenomenon of neural collapse [V. Papyan, X. Y. Han, D. L. Donoho, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 117, 24652-24663 (2020)]. More importantly, when moving to the imbalanced case, our analysis of the Layer-Peeled Model reveals a hitherto-unknown phenomenon that we term Minority Collapse, which fundamentally limits the performance of deep-learning models on the minority classes. In addition, we use the Layer-Peeled Model to gain insights into how to mitigate Minority Collapse. Interestingly, this phenomenon is first predicted by the Layer-Peeled Model before being confirmed by our computational experiments."
The prediction and analysis of COVID-19 epidemic trend by combining LSTM and Markov method,other,None,"Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread rapidly to countries all around the world from the end of 2019, which caused a great impact on global health and has had a huge impact on many countries. Since there is still no effective treatment, it is essential to making effective predictions for relevant departments to make responses and arrangements in advance. Under the limited data, the prediction error of LSTM model will increase over time, and its prone to big bias for medium- and long-term prediction. To overcome this problem, our study proposed a LSTM-Markov model, which uses Markov model to reduce the prediction error of LSTM model. Based on confirmed case data in the US, Britain, Brazil and Russia, we calculated the training errors of LSTM and constructed the probability transfer matrix of the Markov model by the errors. And finally, the prediction results were obtained by combining the output data of LSTM model with the prediction errors of Markov Model. The results show that: compared with the prediction results of the classical LSTM model, the average prediction error of LSTM-Markov is reduced by more than 75%, and the RMSE is reduced by more than 60%, the mean [Formula: see text] of LSTM-Markov is over 0.96. All those indicators demonstrate that the prediction accuracy of proposed LSTM-Markov model is higher than that of the LSTM model to reach more accurate prediction of COVID-19."
Long-term prediction for temporal propagation of seasonal influenza using Transformer-based model,other,"neural network, recurrent neural network","Influenza is one of the most common infectious diseases worldwide, which causes a considerable economic burden on hospitals and other healthcare costs. Predicting new and urgent trends in epidemiological data is an effective way to prevent influenza outbreaks and protect public health. Traditional autoregressive(AR) methods and new deep learning models like Recurrent Neural Network(RNN) have been actively studied to solve the problem. Most existing studies focus on the short-term prediction of influenza. Recently, Transformer models show superior performance in capturing long-range dependency than RNN models. In this paper, we develop a Transformer-based model, which utilizes the potential of the Transformer to increase the prediction capacity. To fuse information from data of different sources and capture the spatial dependency, we design a sources selection module based on measuring curve similarity. Our model is compared with the widely used AR models and RNN-based models on USA and Japan datasets. Results show that our approach provides approximate performance in short-term forecasting and better performance in long-term forecasting."
COUnty aggRegation mixup AuGmEntation (COURAGE) COVID-19 prediction,text mining,None,"The global spread of COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, has casted a significant threat to mankind. As the COVID-19 situation continues to evolve, predicting localized disease severity is crucial for advanced resource allocation. This paper proposes a method named COURAGE (COUnty aggRegation mixup AuGmEntation) to generate a short-term prediction of 2-week-ahead COVID-19 related deaths for each county in the United States, leveraging modern deep learning techniques. Specifically, our method adopts a self-attention model from Natural Language Processing, known as the transformer model, to capture both short-term and long-term dependencies within the time series while enjoying computational efficiency. Our model solely utilizes publicly available information for COVID-19 related confirmed cases, deaths, community mobility trends and demographic information, and can produce state-level predictions as an aggregation of the corresponding county-level predictions. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that our model achieves the state-of-the-art performance among the publicly available benchmark models."
The predictive skill of convolutional neural networks models for disease forecasting,other,"neural network, convolutional neural network, recurrent neural network","In this paper we investigate the utility of one-dimensional convolutional neural network (CNN) models in epidemiological forecasting. Deep learning models, in particular variants of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have been studied for ILI (Influenza-Like Illness) forecasting, and have achieved a higher forecasting skill compared to conventional models such as ARIMA. In this study, we adapt two neural networks that employ one-dimensional temporal convolutional layers as a primary building block-temporal convolutional networks and simple neural attentive meta-learners-for epidemiological forecasting. We then test them with influenza data from the US collected over 2010-2019. We find that epidemiological forecasting with CNNs is feasible, and their forecasting skill is comparable to, and at times, superior to, plain RNNs. Thus CNNs and RNNs bring the power of nonlinear transformations to purely data-driven epidemiological models, a capability that heretofore has been limited to more elaborate mechanistic/compartmental disease models."
A long short-term memory-fully connected (LSTM-FC) neural network for predicting the incidence of bronchopneumonia in children,other,neural network,"Bronchopneumonia is the most common infectious disease in children, and it seriously endangers children's health. In this paper, a deep neural network combining long short-term memory (LSTM) layers and fully connected layers was proposed to predict the prevalence of bronchopneumonia in children in Chengdu based on environmental factors and previous prevalence rates. The mean square error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and Pearson correlation coefficient (R) were used to detect the performance of the deep learning model. The values of MSE, MAE, and R in the test dataset are 0.0051, 0.053, and 0.846, respectively. The results show that the proposed model can accurately predict the prevalence of bronchopneumonia in children. We also compared the proposed model with three other models, namely, a fully connected (FC) layer neural network, a random forest model, and a support vector machine. The results show that the proposed model achieves better performance than the three other models by capturing time series and mitigating the lag effect."
Peel learning for pathway-related outcome prediction,other,"neural network, feedforward neural network","MOTIVATION: Traditional regression models are limited in outcome prediction due to their parametric nature. Current deep learning methods allow for various effects and interactions and have shown improved performance, but they typically need to be trained on a large amount of data to obtain reliable results. Gene expression studies often have small sample sizes but high dimensional correlated predictors so that traditional deep learning methods are not readily applicable.
RESULTS: In this article, we proposed peel learning, a novel neural network that incorporates the prior relationship among genes. In each layer of learning, overall structure is peeled into multiple local substructures. Within the substructure, dependency among variables is reduced through linear projections. The overall structure is gradually simplified over layers and weight parameters are optimized through a revised backpropagation. We applied PL to a small lung transplantation study to predict recipients' post-surgery primary graft dysfunction using donors' gene expressions within several immunology pathways, where PL showed improved prediction accuracy compared to conventional penalized regression, classification trees, feed-forward neural network and a neural network assuming prior network structure. Through simulation studies, we also demonstrated the advantage of adding specific structure among predictor variables in neural network, over no or uniform group structure, which is more favorable in smaller studies. The empirical evidence is consistent with our theoretical proof of improved upper bound of PL's complexity over ordinary neural networks.
AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: PL algorithm was implemented in Python and the open-source code and instruction will be available at https://github.com/Likelyt/Peel-Learning.

DeepImmuno: deep learning-empowered prediction and generation of immunogenic peptides for T-cell immunity,other,"neural network, convolutional neural network","Cytolytic T-cells play an essential role in the adaptive immune system by seeking out, binding and killing cells that present foreign antigens on their surface. An improved understanding of T-cell immunity will greatly aid in the development of new cancer immunotherapies and vaccines for life-threatening pathogens. Central to the design of such targeted therapies are computational methods to predict non-native peptides to elicit a T-cell response, however, we currently lack accurate immunogenicity inference methods. Another challenge is the ability to accurately simulate immunogenic peptides for specific human leukocyte antigen alleles, for both synthetic biological applications, and to augment real training datasets. Here, we propose a beta-binomial distribution approach to derive peptide immunogenic potential from sequence alone. We conducted systematic benchmarking of five traditional machine learning (ElasticNet, K-nearest neighbors, support vector machine, Random Forest and AdaBoost) and three deep learning models (convolutional neural network (CNN), Residual Net and graph neural network) using three independent prior validated immunogenic peptide collections (dengue virus, cancer neoantigen and SARS-CoV-2). We chose the CNN as the best prediction model, based on its adaptivity for small and large datasets and performance relative to existing methods. In addition to outperforming two highly used immunogenicity prediction algorithms, DeepImmuno-CNN correctly predicts which residues are most important for T-cell antigen recognition and predicts novel impacts of SARS-CoV-2 variants. Our independent generative adversarial network (GAN) approach, DeepImmuno-GAN, was further able to accurately simulate immunogenic peptides with physicochemical properties and immunogenicity predictions similar to that of real antigens. We provide DeepImmuno-CNN as source code and an easy-to-use web interface."
Contextual Embeddings from Clinical Notes Improves Prediction of Sepsis,other,None,"Sepsis, a life-threatening organ dysfunction, is a clinical syndrome triggered by acute infection and affects over 1 million Americans every year. Untreated sepsis can progress to septic shock and organ failure, making sepsis one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in hospitals. Early detection of sepsis and timely antibiotics administration is known to save lives. In this work, we design a sepsis prediction algorithm based on data from electronic health records (EHR) using a deep learning approach. While most existing EHR-based sepsis prediction models utilize structured data including vitals, labs, and clinical information, we show that incorporation of features based on clinical texts, using a pre-trained neural language representation model, allows for incorporation of unstructured data without an explicit need for ontology-based named-entity recognition and classification. The proposed model is trained on a large critical care database of over 40,000 patients, including 2805 septic patients, and is compared against competing baseline models. In comparison to a baseline model based on structured data alone, incorporation of clinical texts improved AUC from 0.81 to 0.84. Our findings indicate that incorporation of clinical text features via a pre-trained language representation model can improve early prediction of sepsis and reduce false alarms."
Intelligent Diagnosis of Thyroid Ultrasound Imaging Using an Ensemble of Deep Learning Methods,other,"neural network, convolutional neural network","Background and Objectives: At present, thyroid disorders have a great incidence in the worldwide population, so the development of alternative methods for improving the diagnosis process is necessary. Materials and Methods: For this purpose, we developed an ensemble method that fused two deep learning models, one based on convolutional neural network and the other based on transfer learning. For the first model, called 5-CNN, we developed an efficient end-to-end trained model with five convolutional layers, while for the second model, the pre-trained VGG-19 architecture was repurposed, optimized and trained. We trained and validated our models using a dataset of ultrasound images consisting of four types of thyroidal images: autoimmune, nodular, micro-nodular, and normal. Results: Excellent results were obtained by the ensemble CNN-VGG method, which outperformed the 5-CNN and VGG-19 models: 97.35% for the overall test accuracy with an overall specificity of 98.43%, sensitivity of 95.75%, positive and negative predictive value of 95.41%, and 98.05%. The micro average areas under each receiver operating characteristic curves was 0.96. The results were also validated by two physicians: an endocrinologist and a pediatrician. Conclusions: We proposed a new deep learning study for classifying ultrasound thyroidal images to assist physicians in the diagnosis process."
Long-term mortality risk stratification of liver transplant recipients: real-time application of deep learning algorithms on longitudinal data,other,None,"BACKGROUND: Survival of liver transplant recipients beyond 1 year since transplantation is compromised by an increased risk of cancer, cardiovascular events, infection, and graft failure. Few clinical tools are available to identify patients at risk of these complications, which would flag them for screening tests and potentially life-saving interventions. In this retrospective analysis, we aimed to assess the ability of deep learning algorithms of longitudinal data from two prospective cohorts to predict complications resulting in death after liver transplantation over multiple timeframes, compared with logistic regression models.
METHODS: In this machine learning analysis, model development was done on a set of 42 146 liver transplant recipients (mean age 48·6 years [SD 17·3]; 17 196 [40·8%] women) from the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients (SRTR) in the USA. Transferability of the model was further evaluated by fine-tuning on a dataset from the University Health Network (UHN) in Canada (n=3269; mean age 52·5 years [11·1]; 1079 [33·0%] women). The primary outcome was cause of death, as recorded in the databases, due to cardiovascular causes, infection, graft failure, or cancer, within 1 year and 5 years of each follow-up examination after transplantation. We compared the performance of four deep learning models against logistic regression, assessing performance using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC).
FINDINGS: In both datasets, deep learning models outperformed logistic regression, with the Transformer model achieving the highest AUROCs in both datasets (p<0·0001). The AUROC for the Transformer model across all outcomes in the SRTR dataset was 0·804 (99% CI 0·795-0·854) for 1-year predictions and 0·733 (0·729-0·769) for 5-year predictions. In the UHN dataset, the AUROC for the top-performing deep learning model was 0·807 (0·795-0·842) for 1-year predictions and 0·722 (0·705-0·764) for 5-year predictions. AUROCs ranged from 0·695 (0·680-0·713) for prediction of death from infection within 5 years to 0·859 (0·847-0·871) for prediction of death by graft failure within 1 year.
INTERPRETATION: Deep learning algorithms can incorporate longitudinal information to continuously predict long-term outcomes after liver transplantation, outperforming logistic regression models. Physicians could use these algorithms at routine follow-up visits to identify liver transplant recipients at risk for adverse outcomes and prevent these complications by modifying management based on ranked features.

Accessory pathway analysis using a multimodal deep learning model,other,"neural network, convolutional neural network","Cardiac accessory pathways (APs) in Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome are conventionally diagnosed with decision tree algorithms; however, there are problems with clinical usage. We assessed the efficacy of the artificial intelligence model using electrocardiography (ECG) and chest X-rays to identify the location of APs. We retrospectively used ECG and chest X-rays to analyse 206 patients with WPW syndrome. Each AP location was defined by an electrophysiological study and divided into four classifications. We developed a deep learning model to classify AP locations and compared the accuracy with that of conventional algorithms. Moreover, 1519 chest X-ray samples from other datasets were used for prior learning, and the combined chest X-ray image and ECG data were put into the previous model to evaluate whether the accuracy improved. The convolutional neural network (CNN) model using ECG data was significantly more accurate than the conventional tree algorithm. In the multimodal model, which implemented input from the combined ECG and chest X-ray data, the accuracy was significantly improved. Deep learning with a combination of ECG and chest X-ray data could effectively identify the AP location, which may be a novel deep learning model for a multimodal model."
Explainable automated coding of clinical notes using hierarchical label-wise attention networks and label embedding initialisation,other,"neural network, convolutional neural network, recurrent neural network","BACKGROUND: Diagnostic or procedural coding of clinical notes aims to derive a coded summary of disease-related information about patients. Such coding is usually done manually in hospitals but could potentially be automated to improve the efficiency and accuracy of medical coding. Recent studies on deep learning for automated medical coding achieved promising performances. However, the explainability of these models is usually poor, preventing them to be used confidently in supporting clinical practice. Another limitation is that these models mostly assume independence among labels, ignoring the complex correlations among medical codes which can potentially be exploited to improve the performance.
METHODS: To address the issues of model explainability and label correlations, we propose a Hierarchical Label-wise Attention Network (HLAN), which aimed to interpret the model by quantifying importance (as attention weights) of words and sentences related to each of the labels. Secondly, we propose to enhance the major deep learning models with a label embedding (LE) initialisation approach, which learns a dense, continuous vector representation and then injects the representation into the final layers and the label-wise attention layers in the models. We evaluated the methods using three settings on the MIMIC-III discharge summaries: full codes, top-50 codes, and the UK NHS (National Health Service) COVID-19 (Coronavirus disease 2019) shielding codes. Experiments were conducted to compare the HLAN model and label embedding initialisation to the state-of-the-art neural network based methods, including variants of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs).
RESULTS: HLAN achieved the best Micro-level AUC and F<sub>1</sub> on the top-50 code prediction, 91.9% and 64.1%, respectively; and comparable results on the NHS COVID-19 shielding code prediction to other models: around 97% Micro-level AUC. More importantly, in the analysis of model explanations, by highlighting the most salient words and sentences for each label, HLAN showed more meaningful and comprehensive model interpretation compared to the CNN-based models and its downgraded baselines, HAN and HA-GRU. Label embedding (LE) initialisation significantly boosted the previous state-of-the-art model, CNN with attention mechanisms, on the full code prediction to 52.5% Micro-level F<sub>1</sub>. The analysis of the layers initialised with label embeddings further explains the effect of this initialisation approach. The source code of the implementation and the results are openly available at https://github.com/acadTags/Explainable-Automated-Medical-Coding.
CONCLUSION: We draw the conclusion from the evaluation results and analyses. First, with hierarchical label-wise attention mechanisms, HLAN can provide better or comparable results for automated coding to the state-of-the-art, CNN-based models. Second, HLAN can provide more comprehensive explanations for each label by highlighting key words and sentences in the discharge summaries, compared to the n-grams in the CNN-based models and the downgraded baselines, HAN and HA-GRU. Third, the performance of deep learning based multi-label classification for automated coding can be consistently boosted by initialising label embeddings that captures the correlations among labels. We further discuss the advantages and drawbacks of the overall method regarding its potential to be deployed to a hospital and suggest areas for future studies."
Development and Validation of a Personalized Survival Prediction Model for Uterine Adenosarcoma: A Population-Based Deep Learning Study,other,neural network,"BACKGROUND: The aim was to develop a personalized survival prediction deep learning model for adenosarcoma patients using the surveillance, epidemiology and end results (SEER) database.
METHODS: A total of 797 uterine adenosarcoma patients were enrolled in this study. Duplicated and useless variables were excluded, and 15 variables were selected for further analyses, including age, grade, positive lymph nodes or not, marital status, race, tumor extension, stage, and surgery or not. We created our deep survival learning (DSL) model to manipulate the data, which was randomly split into a training set (n = 519, 65%), validation set (n = 143, 18%) and testing set (n = 143, 18%). The Cox proportional hazard (CPH) model was also included comparatively. Finally, personalized survival curves were plotted for randomly selected patients.
RESULTS: The c-index for the CPH model was 0.726, and the Brier score was 0.17. For our deep survival learning model, we achieved a c-index of 0.774 and a Brier score of 0.14 in the external testing set. In addition, the limitations of the traditional staging system were revealed, and a personalized survival prediction system based on our risk scoring grouping was developed.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study developed a deep neural network model for adenosarcoma. The performance of this model was superior to that of the traditional Cox proportional hazard model. In addition, a personalized survival prediction system was developed based on our deep survival learning model, which provided more accurate prognostic information for adenosarcoma patients."
Development and Validation of a Deep Learning Based Diabetes Prediction System Using a Nationwide Population-Based Cohort,other,"neural network, recurrent neural network","BACKGROUND: Previously developed prediction models for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) have limited performance. We developed a deep learning (DL) based model using a cohort representative of the Korean population.
METHODS: This study was conducted on the basis of the National Health Insurance Service-Health Screening (NHIS-HEALS) cohort of Korea. Overall, 335,302 subjects without T2DM at baseline were included. We developed the model based on 80% of the subjects, and verified the power in the remainder. Predictive models for T2DM were constructed using the recurrent neural network long short-term memory (RNN-LSTM) network and the Cox longitudinal summary model. The performance of both models over a 10-year period was compared using a time dependent area under the curve.
RESULTS: During a mean follow-up of 10.4±1.7 years, the mean frequency of periodic health check-ups was 2.9±1.0 per subject. During the observation period, T2DM was newly observed in 8.7% of the subjects. The annual performance of the model created using the RNN-LSTM network was superior to that of the Cox model, and the risk factors for T2DM, derived using the two models were similar; however, certain results differed.
CONCLUSION: The DL-based T2DM prediction model, constructed using a cohort representative of the population, performs better than the conventional model. After pilot tests, this model will be provided to all Korean national health screening recipients in the future."
De novo design of new chemical entities for SARS-CoV-2 using artificial intelligence,other,neural network,"Background: The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has severely affected the health and economy of several countries. Multiple studies are in progress to design novel therapeutics against the potential target proteins in SARS-CoV-2, including 3CL protease, an essential protein for virus replication. Materials &amp; methods: In this study we employed deep neural network-based generative and predictive models for de novo design of small molecules capable of inhibiting the 3CL protease. The generative model was optimized using transfer learning and reinforcement learning to focus around the chemical space corresponding to the protease inhibitors. Multiple physicochemical property filters and virtual screening score were used for the final screening. Conclusion: We have identified 33 potential compounds as ideal candidates for further synthesis and testing against SARS-CoV-2."
Using Automated Machine Learning to Predict the Mortality of Patients With COVID-19: Prediction Model Development Study,other,machine learning model,"BACKGROUND: During a pandemic, it is important for clinicians to stratify patients and decide who receives limited medical resources. Machine learning models have been proposed to accurately predict COVID-19 disease severity. Previous studies have typically tested only one machine learning algorithm and limited performance evaluation to area under the curve analysis. To obtain the best results possible, it may be important to test different machine learning algorithms to find the best prediction model.
OBJECTIVE: In this study, we aimed to use automated machine learning (autoML) to train various machine learning algorithms. We selected the model that best predicted patients' chances of surviving a SARS-CoV-2 infection. In addition, we identified which variables (ie, vital signs, biomarkers, comorbidities, etc) were the most influential in generating an accurate model.
METHODS: Data were retrospectively collected from all patients who tested positive for COVID-19 at our institution between March 1 and July 3, 2020. We collected 48 variables from each patient within 36 hours before or after the index time (ie, real-time polymerase chain reaction positivity). Patients were followed for 30 days or until death. Patients' data were used to build 20 machine learning models with various algorithms via autoML. The performance of machine learning models was measured by analyzing the area under the precision-recall curve (AUPCR). Subsequently, we established model interpretability via Shapley additive explanation and partial dependence plots to identify and rank variables that drove model predictions. Afterward, we conducted dimensionality reduction to extract the 10 most influential variables. AutoML models were retrained by only using these 10 variables, and the output models were evaluated against the model that used 48 variables.
RESULTS: Data from 4313 patients were used to develop the models. The best model that was generated by using autoML and 48 variables was the stacked ensemble model (AUPRC=0.807). The two best independent models were the gradient boost machine and extreme gradient boost models, which had an AUPRC of 0.803 and 0.793, respectively. The deep learning model (AUPRC=0.73) was substantially inferior to the other models. The 10 most influential variables for generating high-performing models were systolic and diastolic blood pressure, age, pulse oximetry level, blood urea nitrogen level, lactate dehydrogenase level, D-dimer level, troponin level, respiratory rate, and Charlson comorbidity score. After the autoML models were retrained with these 10 variables, the stacked ensemble model still had the best performance (AUPRC=0.791).
CONCLUSIONS: We used autoML to develop high-performing models that predicted the survival of patients with COVID-19. In addition, we identified important variables that correlated with mortality. This is proof of concept that autoML is an efficient, effective, and informative method for generating machine learning-based clinical decision support tools."
Lung cancer survival period prediction and understanding: Deep learning approaches,other,"neural network, artificial neural network, machine learning model, convolutional neural network, recurrent neural network","INTRODUCTION: Survival period prediction through early diagnosis of cancer has many benefits. It allows both patients and caregivers to plan resources, time and intensity of care to provide the best possible treatment path for the patients. In this paper, by focusing on lung cancer patients, we build several survival prediction models using deep learning techniques to tackle both cancer survival classification and regression problems. We also conduct feature importance analysis to understand how lung cancer patients' relevant factors impact their survival periods. We contribute to identifying an approach to estimate survivability that are commonly and practically appropriate for medical use.
METHODOLOGIES: We have compared the performance across three of the most popular deep learning architectures - Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) while comparing the performing of deep learning models against traditional machine learning models. The data was obtained from the lung cancer section of Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) cancer registry.
RESULTS: The deep learning models outperformed traditional machine learning models across both classification and regression approaches. We obtained a best of 71.18 % accuracy for the classification approach when patients' survival periods are segmented into classes of '&lt;=6 months',' 0.5 - 2 years' and '&gt;2 years' and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 13.5 % andR2 value of 0.5 for the regression approach for the deep learning models while the traditional machine learning models saturated at 61.12 % classification accuracy and 14.87 % RMSE in regression.
CONCLUSIONS: This approach can be a baseline for early prediction with predictions that can be further improved with more temporal treatment information collected from treated patients. In addition, we evaluated the feature importance to investigate the model interpretability, gaining further insight into the survival analysis models and the factors that are important in cancer survival period prediction."
Application of deep learning to predict advanced neoplasia using big clinical data in colorectal cancer screening of asymptomatic adults,other,neural network,"BACKGROUND/AIMS: We aimed to develop a deep learning model for the prediction of the risk of advanced colorectal neoplasia (ACRN) in asymptomatic adults, based on which colorectal cancer screening could be customized.
METHODS: We collected data on 26 clinical and laboratory parameters, including age, sex, smoking status, body mass index, complete blood count, blood chemistry, and tumor marker, from 70,336 first-time colonoscopy screening recipients. For reference, we used a logistic regression (LR) model with nine variables manually selected from the 26 variables. A deep neural network (DNN) model was developed using all 26 variables. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity, and specificity of the models were compared in a randomly split validation group.
RESULTS: In comparison with the LR model (AUC, 0.724; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.684 to 0.765), the DNN model (AUC, 0.760; 95% CI, 0.724 to 0.795) demonstrated significantly improved performance with respect to the prediction of ACRN (p < 0.001). At a sensitivity of 90%, the specificity significantly increased with the application of the DNN model (41.0%) in comparison with the LR model (26.5%) (p < 0.001), indicating that the colonoscopy workload required to detect the same number of ACRNs could be reduced by 20%.
CONCLUSION: The application of DNN to big clinical data could significantly improve the prediction of ACRNs in comparison with the LR model, potentially realizing further customization by utilizing large quantities and various types of biomedical information."
Deep neural network models for identifying incident dementia using claims and EHR datasets,other,"neural network, machine learning model, recurrent neural network","This study investigates the use of deep learning methods to improve the accuracy of a predictive model for dementia, and compares the performance to a traditional machine learning model. With sufficient accuracy the model can be deployed as a first round screening tool for clinical follow-up including neurological examination, neuropsychological testing, imaging and recruitment to clinical trials. Seven cohorts with two years of data, three to eight years prior to index date, and an incident cohort were created. Four trained models for each cohort, boosted trees, feed forward network, recurrent neural network and recurrent neural network with pre-trained weights, were constructed and their performance compared using validation and test data. The incident model had an AUC of 94.4% and F1 score of 54.1%. Eight years removed from index date the AUC and F1 scores were 80.7% and 25.6%, respectively. The results for the remaining cohorts were between these ranges. Deep learning models can result in significant improvement in performance but come at a cost in terms of run times and hardware requirements. The results of the model at index date indicate that this modeling can be effective at stratifying patients at risk of dementia. At this time, the inability to sustain this quality at longer lead times is more an issue of data availability and quality rather than one of algorithm choices."
Real-World Implications of a Rapidly Responsive COVID-19 Spread Model with Time-Dependent Parameters via Deep Learning: Model Development and Validation,other,neural network,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has caused major disruptions worldwide since March 2020. The experience of the 1918 influenza pandemic demonstrated that decreases in the infection rates of COVID-19 do not guarantee continuity of the trend.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to develop a precise spread model of COVID-19 with time-dependent parameters via deep learning to respond promptly to the dynamic situation of the outbreak and proactively minimize damage.
METHODS: In this study, we investigated a mathematical model with time-dependent parameters via deep learning based on forward-inverse problems. We used data from the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) and the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University for Korea and the other countries, respectively. Because the data consist of confirmed, recovered, and deceased cases, we selected the susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model and found approximated solutions as well as model parameters. Specifically, we applied fully connected neural networks to the solutions and parameters and designed suitable loss functions.
RESULTS: We developed an entirely new SIR model with time-dependent parameters via deep learning methods. Furthermore, we validated the model with the conventional Runge-Kutta fourth order model to confirm its convergent nature. In addition, we evaluated our model based on the real-world situation reported from the KCDC, the Korean government, and news media. We also crossvalidated our model using data from the CSSE for Italy, Sweden, and the United States.
CONCLUSIONS: The methodology and new model of this study could be employed for short-term prediction of COVID-19, which could help the government prepare for a new outbreak. In addition, from the perspective of measuring medical resources, our model has powerful strength because it assumes all the parameters as time-dependent, which reflects the exact status of viral spread."
Research of Epidemic Big Data Based on Improved Deep Convolutional Neural Network,other,"neural network, convolutional neural network","In recent years, with the acceleration of the aging process and the aggravation of life pressure, the proportion of chronic epidemics has gradually increased. A large amount of medical data will be generated during the hospitalization of diabetics. It will have important practical significance and social value to discover potential medical laws and valuable information among medical data. In view of this, an improved deep convolutional neural network (""CNN+"" for short) algorithm was proposed to predict the changes of diabetes. Firstly, the bagging integrated classification algorithm was used instead of the output layer function of the deep CNN, which can help the improved deep CNN algorithm constructed for the data set of diabetic patients and improve the accuracy of classification. In this way, the ""CNN+"" algorithm can take the advantages of both the deep CNN and the bagging algorithm. On the one hand, it can extract the potential features of the data set by using the powerful feature extraction ability of deep CNN. On the other hand, the bagging integrated classification algorithm can be used for feature classification, so as to improve the classification accuracy and obtain better disease prediction effect to assist doctors in diagnosis and treatment. Experimental results show that compared with the traditional convolutional neural network and other classification algorithm, the ""CNN+"" model can get more reliable prediction results."
Early detection of sepsis utilizing deep learning on electronic health record event sequences,other,"neural network, machine learning model, convolutional neural network","BACKGROUND: The timeliness of detection of a sepsis incidence in progress is a crucial factor in the outcome for the patient. Machine learning models built from data in electronic health records can be used as an effective tool for improving this timeliness, but so far, the potential for clinical implementations has been largely limited to studies in intensive care units. This study will employ a richer data set that will expand the applicability of these models beyond intensive care units. Furthermore, we will circumvent several important limitations that have been found in the literature: (1) Model evaluations neglect the clinical consequences of a decision to start, or not start, an intervention for sepsis. (2) Models are evaluated shortly before sepsis onset without considering interventions already initiated. (3) Machine learning models are built on a restricted set of clinical parameters, which are not necessarily measured in all departments. (4) Model performance is limited by current knowledge of sepsis, as feature interactions and time dependencies are hard-coded into the model.
METHODS: In this study, we present a model to overcome these shortcomings using a deep learning approach on a diverse multicenter data set. We used retrospective data from multiple Danish hospitals over a seven-year period. Our sepsis detection system is constructed as a combination of a convolutional neural network and a long short-term memory network. We assess model quality by standard concepts of accuracy as well as clinical usefulness, and we suggest a retrospective assessment of interventions by looking at intravenous antibiotics and blood cultures preceding the prediction time.
RESULTS: Results show performance ranging from AUROC 0.856 (3 h before sepsis onset) to AUROC 0.756 (24 h before sepsis onset). Evaluating the clinical utility of the model, we find that a large proportion of septic patients did not receive antibiotic treatment or blood culture at the time of the sepsis prediction, and the model could, therefore, facilitate such interventions at an earlier point in time.
CONCLUSION: We present a deep learning system for early detection of sepsis that can learn characteristics of the key factors and interactions from the raw event sequence data itself, without relying on a labor-intensive feature extraction work. Our system outperforms baseline models, such as gradient boosting, which rely on specific data elements and therefore suffer from many missing values in our dataset."
Development and Validation of a Deep Learning Model for Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Survival,other,neural network,"IMPORTANCE: There is a lack of studies exploring the performance of a deep learning survival neural network in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
OBJECTIVES: To compare the performances of DeepSurv, a deep learning survival neural network with a tumor, node, and metastasis staging system in the prediction of survival and test the reliability of individual treatment recommendations provided by the deep learning survival neural network.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this population-based cohort study, a deep learning-based algorithm was developed and validated using consecutive cases of newly diagnosed stages I to IV NSCLC between January 2010 and December 2015 in a Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database. A total of 127 features, including patient characteristics, tumor stage, and treatment strategies, were assessed for analysis. The algorithm was externally validated on an independent test cohort, comprising 1182 patients with stage I to III NSCLC diagnosed between January 2009 and December 2013 in Shanghai Pulmonary Hospital. Analysis began January 2018 and ended June 2019.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The deep learning survival neural network model was compared with the tumor, node, and metastasis staging system for lung cancer-specific survival. The C statistic was used to assess the performance of models. A user-friendly interface was provided to facilitate the survival predictions and treatment recommendations of the deep learning survival neural network model.
RESULTS: Of 17 322 patients with NSCLC included in the study, 13 361 (77.1%) were white and the median (interquartile range) age was 68 (61-74) years. The majority of tumors were stage I disease (10 273 [59.3%]) and adenocarcinoma (11 985 [69.2%]). The median (interquartile range) follow-up time was 24 (10-43) months. There were 3119 patients who had lung cancer-related death during the follow-up period. The deep learning survival neural network model showed more promising results in the prediction of lung cancer-specific survival than the tumor, node, and metastasis stage on the test data set (C statistic = 0.739 vs 0.706). The population who received the recommended treatments had superior survival rates than those who received treatments not recommended (hazard ratio, 2.99; 95% CI, 2.49-3.59; P < .001), which was verified by propensity score-matched groups. The deep learning survival neural network model visualization was realized by a user-friendly graphic interface.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The deep learning survival neural network model shows potential benefits in prognostic evaluation and treatment recommendation with respect to lung cancer-specific survival. This novel analytical approach may provide reliable individual survival information and treatment recommendations."
Drug Resistance Prediction Using Deep Learning Techniques on HIV-1 Sequence Data,other,"neural network, multilayer perceptron, convolutional neural network, recurrent neural network","The fast replication rate and lack of repair mechanisms of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) contribute to its high mutation frequency, with some mutations resulting in the evolution of resistance to antiretroviral therapies (ART). As such, studying HIV drug resistance allows for real-time evaluation of evolutionary mechanisms. Characterizing the biological process of drug resistance is also critically important for sustained effectiveness of ART. Investigating the link between ""black box"" deep learning methods applied to this problem and evolutionary principles governing drug resistance has been overlooked to date. Here, we utilized publicly available HIV-1 sequence data and drug resistance assay results for 18 ART drugs to evaluate the performance of three architectures (multilayer perceptron, bidirectional recurrent neural network, and convolutional neural network) for drug resistance prediction, jointly with biological analysis. We identified convolutional neural networks as the best performing architecture and displayed a correspondence between the importance of biologically relevant features in the classifier and overall performance. Our results suggest that the high classification performance of deep learning models is indeed dependent on drug resistance mutations (DRMs). These models heavily weighted several features that are not known DRM locations, indicating the utility of model interpretability to address causal relationships in viral genotype-phenotype data."
An artificial intelligence algorithm that identifies middle turbinate pneumatisation (concha bullosa) on sinus computed tomography scans,other,"neural network, convolutional neural network","OBJECTIVE: Convolutional neural networks are a subclass of deep learning or artificial intelligence that are predominantly used for image analysis and classification. This proof-of-concept study attempts to train a convolutional neural network algorithm that can reliably determine if the middle turbinate is pneumatised (concha bullosa) on coronal sinus computed tomography images.
METHOD: Consecutive high-resolution computed tomography scans of the paranasal sinuses were retrospectively collected between January 2016 and December 2018 at a tertiary rhinology hospital in Australia. The classification layer of Inception-V3 was retrained in Python using a transfer learning method to interpret the computed tomography images. Segmentation analysis was also performed in an attempt to increase diagnostic accuracy.
RESULTS: The trained convolutional neural network was found to have diagnostic accuracy of 81 per cent (95 per cent confidence interval: 73.0-89.0 per cent) with an area under the curve of 0.93.
CONCLUSION: A trained convolutional neural network algorithm appears to successfully identify pneumatisation of the middle turbinate with high accuracy. Further studies can be pursued to test its ability in other clinically important anatomical variants in otolaryngology and rhinology."
Using artificial intelligence (AI) to predict postoperative surgical site infection: A retrospective cohort of 4046 posterior spinal fusions,other,neural network,"OBJECTIVES: Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence (AI) are rapidly growing in capability and increasingly applied to model outcomes and complications within medicine. In spinal surgery, post-operative surgical site infections (SSIs) are a rare, yet morbid complication. This paper applied AI to predict SSIs after posterior spinal fusions.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: 4046 posterior spinal fusions were identified at a single academic center. A Deep Neural Network DNN classification model was trained using 35 unique input variables The model was trained and tested using cross-validation, in which the data were randomly partitioned into training n = 3034 and testing n = 1012 datasets. Stepwise multivariate regression was further used to identify actual model weights based on predictions from our trained model.
RESULTS: The overall rate of infection was 1.5 %. The mean area under the curve (AUC), representing the accuracy of the model, across all 300 iterations was 0.775 (95 % CI [0.767,0.782]) with a median AUC of 0.787. The positive predictive value (PPV), representing how well the model predicted SSI when a patient had SSI, over all predictions was 92.56 % with a negative predictive value (NPV), representing how well the model predicted absence of SSI when a patient did not have SSI, of 98.45 %. In analyzing relative model weights, the five highest weighted variables were Congestive Heart Failure, Chronic Pulmonary Failure, Hemiplegia/Paraplegia, Multilevel Fusion and Cerebrovascular Disease respectively. Notable factors that were protective against infection were ICU Admission, Increasing Charlson Comorbidity Score, Race (White), and being male. Minimally invasive surgery (MIS) was also determined to be mildly protective.
CONCLUSION: Machine learning and artificial intelligence are relevant and impressive tools that should be employed in the clinical decision making for patients. The variables with the largest model weights were primarily comorbidity related with the exception of multilevel fusion. Further study is needed, however, in order to draw any definitive conclusions."
Forecast of Dengue Cases in 20 Chinese Cities Based on the Deep Learning Method,other,"neural network, recurrent neural network","Dengue fever (DF) is one of the most rapidly spreading diseases in the world, and accurate forecasts of dengue in a timely manner might help local government implement effective control measures. To obtain the accurate forecasting of DF cases, it is crucial to model the long-term dependency in time series data, which is difficult for a typical machine learning method. This study aimed to develop a timely accurate forecasting model of dengue based on long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural networks while only considering monthly dengue cases and climate factors. The performance of LSTM models was compared with the other previously published models when predicting DF cases one month into the future. Our results showed that the LSTM model reduced the average the root mean squared error (RMSE) of the predictions by 12.99% to 24.91% and reduced the average RMSE of the predictions in the outbreak period by 15.09% to 26.82% as compared with other candidate models. The LSTM model achieved superior performance in predicting dengue cases as compared with other previously published forecasting models. Moreover, transfer learning (TL) can improve the generalization ability of the model in areas with fewer dengue incidences. The findings provide a more precise forecasting dengue model and could be used for other dengue-like infectious diseases."
A novel model for malaria prediction based on ensemble algorithms,other,None,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Most previous studies adopted single traditional time series models to predict incidences of malaria. A single model cannot effectively capture all the properties of the data structure. However, a stacking architecture can solve this problem by combining distinct algorithms and models. This study compares the performance of traditional time series models and deep learning algorithms in malaria case prediction and explores the application value of stacking methods in the field of infectious disease prediction.
METHODS: The ARIMA, STL+ARIMA, BP-ANN and LSTM network models were separately applied in simulations using malaria data and meteorological data in Yunnan Province from 2011 to 2017. We compared the predictive performance of each model through evaluation measures: RMSE, MASE, MAD. In addition, gradient-boosting regression trees (GBRTs) were used to combine the above four models. We also determined whether stacking structure improved the model prediction performance.
RESULTS: The root mean square errors (RMSEs) of the four sub-models were 13.176, 14.543, 9.571 and 7.208; the mean absolute scaled errors (MASEs) were 0.469, 0.472, 0.296 and 0.266 and the mean absolute deviation (MAD) were 6.403, 7.658, 5.871 and 5.691. After using the stacking architecture combined with the above four models, the RMSE, MASE and MAD values of the ensemble model decreased to 6.810, 0.224 and 4.625, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: A novel ensemble model based on the robustness of structured prediction and model combination through stacking was developed. The findings suggest that the predictive performance of the final model is superior to that of the other four sub-models, indicating that stacking architecture may have significant implications in infectious disease prediction."
A novel deep learning model using dosimetric and clinical information for grade 4 radiotherapy-induced lymphopenia prediction,other,"neural network, artificial neural network, multilayer perceptron","Radiotherapy-induced lymphopenia has increasingly been shown to reduce cancer survivorship. We developed a novel hybrid deep learning model to efficiently integrate an entire set of dosimetric parameters of a radiation treatment plan with a patient's pre- and mid-treatment information to improve the prediction of grade 4 radiotherapy-induced lymphopenia. We proposed a two-input channel hybrid deep learning model to process dosimetric information using a stacked bi-directional long-short term memory structure and non-dosimetric information using a multilayer perceptron structure independently before integrating the dosimetric and non-dosimetric information for final prediction. The model was trained from 505 patients and tested in 216 patients. We compared our model with other popular predictive models, including logistic regression (with and without elastic-net regularization) random forest, support vector machines, and artificial neural network. Our hybrid deep learning model out-performed other predictive models in various evaluation metrics. It achieved the highest area under the curve at 0.831, accuracy at 0.769, F1 score at 0.631, precision at 0.670, and recall at 0.610. The hybrid deep learning model also demonstrated robustness in exploiting the value of dosimetric parameters in predictive modeling. We demonstrated that our hybrid deep learning model with a two-input channel structure, which addressed the sequential and inter-correlated nature of dosimetric parameters, could potentially improve the prediction of radiotherapy-induced lymphopenia. Our proposed deep learning framework is flexible and transferable to other related radiotherapy-induced toxicities."
Predicting Long-Term Health-Related Quality of Life after Bariatric Surgery Using a Conventional Neural Network: A Study Based on the Scandinavian Obesity Surgery Registry,other,neural network,"Severe obesity has been associated with numerous comorbidities and reduced health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Although many studies have reported changes in HRQoL after bariatric surgery, few were long-term prospective studies. We examined the performance of the convolution neural network (CNN) for predicting 5-year HRQoL after bariatric surgery based on the available preoperative information from the Scandinavian Obesity Surgery Registry (SOReg). CNN was used to predict the 5-year HRQoL after bariatric surgery in a training dataset and evaluated in a test dataset. In general, performance of the CNN model (measured as mean squared error, MSE) increased with more convolution layer filters, computation units, and epochs, and decreased with a larger batch size. The CNN model showed an overwhelming advantage in predicting all the HRQoL measures. The MSEs of the CNN model for training data were 8% to 80% smaller than those of the linear regression model. When the models were evaluated using the test data, the CNN model performed better than the linear regression model. However, the issue of overfitting was apparent in the CNN model. We concluded that the performance of the CNN is better than the traditional multivariate linear regression model in predicting long-term HRQoL after bariatric surgery; however, the overfitting issue needs to be mitigated using more features or more patients to train the model."
Deep-learning model for predicting 30-day postoperative mortality,other,"neural network, convolutional neural network","BACKGROUND: Postoperative mortality occurs in 1-2% of patients undergoing major inpatient surgery. The currently available prediction tools using summaries of intraoperative data are limited by their inability to reflect shifting risk associated with intraoperative physiological perturbations. We sought to compare similar benchmarks to a deep-learning algorithm predicting postoperative 30-day mortality.
METHODS: We constructed a multipath convolutional neural network model using patient characteristics, co-morbid conditions, preoperative laboratory values, and intraoperative numerical data from patients undergoing surgery with tracheal intubation at a single medical centre. Data for 60 min prior to a randomly selected time point were utilised. Model performance was compared with a deep neural network, a random forest, a support vector machine, and a logistic regression using predetermined summary statistics of intraoperative data.
RESULTS: Of 95 907 patients, 941 (1%) died within 30 days. The multipath convolutional neural network predicted postoperative 30-day mortality with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.867 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.835-0.899). This was higher than that for the deep neural network (0.825; 95% CI: 0.790-0.860), random forest (0.848; 95% CI: 0.815-0.882), support vector machine (0.836; 95% CI: 0.802-870), and logistic regression (0.837; 95% CI: 0.803-0.871).
CONCLUSIONS: A deep-learning time-series model improves prediction compared with models with simple summaries of intraoperative data. We have created a model that can be used in real time to detect dynamic changes in a patient's risk for postoperative mortality."
Optimizing neural networks for medical data sets: A case study on neonatal apnea prediction,other,"neural network, machine learning model, multilayer perceptron","OBJECTIVE: The neonatal period of a child is considered the most crucial phase of its physical development and future health. As per the World Health Organization, India has the highest number of pre-term births [1], with over 3.5 million babies born prematurely, and up to 40% of them are babies with low birth weights, highly prone to a multitude of diseases such as Jaundice, Sepsis, Apnea, and other Metabolic disorders. Apnea is the primary concern for caretakers of neonates in intensive care units. The real-time medical data is known to be noisy and nonlinear and to address the resultant complexity in classification and prediction of diseases; there is a need for optimizing learning models to maximize predictive performance. Our study attempts to optimize neural network architectures to predict the occurrence of apneic episodes in neonates, after the first week of admission to Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU). The primary contribution of this study is the formulation and description of a set of generic steps involved in selecting various model-specific, training and hyper-parametric optimization algorithms, as well as model architectures for optimal predictive performance on complex and noisy medical datasets.
METHODS: The data used for the study being inherently complex and noisy, Kernel Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is used to reduce dataset dimensionality for the analysis such as interpretations and visualization of the dataset. Hyper-parametric and parametric optimization, in different categories, are considered, including learning rate updater algorithms, regularization methods, activation functions, gradient descent algorithms and depth of the network, based on their performance on the validation set, to obtain a holistically optimized neural network, that best model the given complex medical dataset. Deep Neural Network Architectures such as Deep Multilayer Perceptron's, Stacked Auto-encoders and Deep Belief Networks are employed to model the dataset, and their performance is compared to the optimized neural network obtained from the parametric exploration. Further, the results are compared with Support Vector Machine (SVM), K Nearest Neighbor, Decision Tree (DT) and Random Forest (RF) algorithms.
RESULTS: The results indicate that the optimized eight layer Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) model, with Adam Decay and Stochastic Gradient Descent (AUC 0.82) can outperform the conventional machine learning models, and perform comparably to the Deep Auto-encoder model (AUC 0.83) in predicting the presence of apnea in neonates.
CONCLUSION: The study shows that an MLP model can undergo significant improvements in predictive performance, by the proposed step-wise optimization. The optimized MLP is proved to be as accurate as deep neural network models such as Deep Belief Networks and Deep Auto-encoders for noisy and nonlinear data sets, and outperform all conventional models like Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree (DT), K Nearest Neighbor and Random Forest (RF) algorithms. The generic nature of the proposed step-wise optimization provides a framework to optimize neural networks on such complex nonlinear datasets. The investigated models can help neonatologists as a diagnostic tool."
A deep survival analysis method based on ranking,other,"neural network, feedforward neural network","Survival analyses of populations and the establishment of prognoses for individual patients are important activities in the practice of medicine. Standard survival models, such as the Cox proportional hazards model, require extensive feature engineering or prior knowledge to model at an individual level. Some survival analysis models can avoid these problems by using machine learning extended the CPH model, and higher performance has been reported. In this paper, we propose an innovative loss function that is defined as the sum of an extended mean squared error loss and a pairwise ranking loss based on ranking information on survival data. We apply this loss function to optimize a deep feed-forward neural network (RankDeepSurv), which can be used to model survival data. We demonstrate that the performance of our model, RankDeepSurv, is superior to that of other state-of-the-art survival models based on an analysis of 4 public medical clinical datasets. When modelling the prognosis of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), RankDeepSurv achieved better prognostic accuracy than the CPH established by clinical experts. The difference between high and low risk groups in the RankDeepSurv model is greater than the difference in the CPH. The results show that our method has considerable potential to model survival data in medical settings."
"Application of a long short-term memory neural network: a burgeoning method of deep learning in forecasting HIV incidence in Guangxi, China",other,neural network,"Guangxi, a province in southwestern China, has the second highest reported number of HIV/AIDS cases in China. This study aimed to develop an accurate and effective model to describe the tendency of HIV and to predict its incidence in Guangxi. HIV incidence data of Guangxi from 2005 to 2016 were obtained from the database of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention. Long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network models, autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models, generalised regression neural network (GRNN) models and exponential smoothing (ES) were used to fit the incidence data. Data from 2015 and 2016 were used to validate the most suitable models. The model performances were evaluated by evaluating metrics, including mean square error (MSE), root mean square error, mean absolute error and mean absolute percentage error. The LSTM model had the lowest MSE when the N value (time step) was 12. The most appropriate ARIMA models for incidence in 2015 and 2016 were ARIMA (1, 1, 2) (0, 1, 2)12 and ARIMA (2, 1, 0) (1, 1, 2)12, respectively. The accuracy of GRNN and ES models in forecasting HIV incidence in Guangxi was relatively poor. Four performance metrics of the LSTM model were all lower than the ARIMA, GRNN and ES models. The LSTM model was more effective than other time-series models and is important for the monitoring and control of local HIV epidemics."
MildInt: Deep Learning-Based Multimodal Longitudinal Data Integration Framework,other,None,"As large amounts of heterogeneous biomedical data become available, numerous methods for integrating such datasets have been developed to extract complementary knowledge from multiple domains of sources. Recently, a deep learning approach has shown promising results in a variety of research areas. However, applying the deep learning approach requires expertise for constructing a deep architecture that can take multimodal longitudinal data. Thus, in this paper, a deep learning-based python package for data integration is developed. The python package deep learning-based multimodal longitudinal data integration framework (MildInt) provides the preconstructed deep learning architecture for a classification task. MildInt contains two learning phases: learning feature representation from each modality of data and training a classifier for the final decision. Adopting deep architecture in the first phase leads to learning more task-relevant feature representation than a linear model. In the second phase, linear regression classifier is used for detecting and investigating biomarkers from multimodal data. Thus, by combining the linear model and the deep learning model, higher accuracy and better interpretability can be achieved. We validated the performance of our package using simulation data and real data. For the real data, as a pilot study, we used clinical and multimodal neuroimaging datasets in Alzheimer's disease to predict the disease progression. MildInt is capable of integrating multiple forms of numerical data including time series and non-time series data for extracting complementary features from the multimodal dataset."
Demystifying the Jargon: The Bridge between Ophthalmology and Artificial Intelligence,other,neural network,"Publications related to artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning have risen exponentially in the past 5 years in the medical literature, including a number of articles involving retinal disease.– The mathematical theories beneath machine learning methods have been around for decades but in most cases were too computationally intense to implement by hand., Recent advances in computer central processing units and graphics processing units have enabled the application of these models to solve real-world problems., This has led to rapid advances in the fields of AI and machine learning, specifically deep learning, and to a growing number of medical and ophthalmic applications.–, As with the rapid evolution of any new technologies, there can be confusion about new terminologies, and AI is no exception. Though they are often used interchangeably, the terms “AI,” “machine learning,” “deep learning,” and “neural networks” are not synonymous and may be confusing for ophthalmologists to distinguish. Below, we attempt to define these terms in a manner accessible to both ophthalmologists and vision researchers (Figure 1)."
Survival outcome prediction in cervical cancer: Cox models vs deep-learning model,other,neural network,"BACKGROUND: Historically, the Cox proportional hazard regression model has been the mainstay for survival analyses in oncologic research. The Cox proportional hazard regression model generally is used based on an assumption of linear association. However, it is likely that, in reality, there are many clinicopathologic features that exhibit a nonlinear association in biomedicine.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to compare the deep-learning neural network model and the Cox proportional hazard regression model in the prediction of survival in women with cervical cancer.
STUDY DESIGN: This was a retrospective pilot study of consecutive cases of newly diagnosed stage I-IV cervical cancer from 2000-2014. A total of 40 features that included patient demographics, vital signs, laboratory test results, tumor characteristics, and treatment types were assessed for analysis and grouped into 3 feature sets. The deep-learning neural network model was compared with the Cox proportional hazard regression model and 3 other survival analysis models for progression-free survival and overall survival. Mean absolute error and concordance index were used to assess the performance of these 5 models.
RESULTS: There were 768 women included in the analysis. The median age was 49 years, and the majority were Hispanic (71.7%). The majority of tumors were squamous (75.3%) and stage I (48.7%). The median follow-up time was 40.2 months; there were 241 events for recurrence and progression and 170 deaths during the follow-up period. The deep-learning model showed promising results in the prediction of progression-free survival when compared with the Cox proportional hazard regression model (mean absolute error, 29.3 vs 316.2). The deep-learning model also outperformed all the other models, including the Cox proportional hazard regression model, for overall survival (mean absolute error, Cox proportional hazard regression vs deep-learning, 43.6 vs 30.7). The performance of the deep-learning model further improved when more features were included (concordance index for progression-free survival: 0.695 for 20 features, 0.787 for 36 features, and 0.795 for 40 features). There were 10 features for progression-free survival and 3 features for overall survival that demonstrated significance only in the deep-learning model, but not in the Cox proportional hazard regression model. There were no features for progression-free survival and 3 features for overall survival that demonstrated significance only in the Cox proportional hazard regression model, but not in the deep-learning model.
CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that the deep-learning neural network model may be a useful analytic tool for survival prediction in women with cervical cancer because it exhibited superior performance compared with the Cox proportional hazard regression model. This novel analytic approach may provide clinicians with meaningful survival information that potentially could be integrated into treatment decision-making and planning. Further validation studies are necessary to support this pilot study."
Deep language space neural network for classifying mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer-type dementia,other,neural network,"It has been quite a challenge to diagnose Mild Cognitive Impairment due to Alzheimer's disease (MCI) and Alzheimer-type dementia (AD-type dementia) using the currently available clinical diagnostic criteria and neuropsychological examinations. As such we propose an automated diagnostic technique using a variant of deep neural networks language models (DNNLM) on the verbal utterances of affected individuals. Motivated by the success of DNNLM on natural language tasks, we propose a combination of deep neural network and deep language models (D2NNLM) for classifying the disease. Results on the DementiaBank language transcript clinical dataset show that D2NNLM sufficiently learned several linguistic biomarkers in the form of higher order n-grams to distinguish the affected group from the healthy group with reasonable accuracy on very sparse clinical datasets."
SENSE: Siamese neural network for sequence embedding and alignment-free comparison,other,neural network,"MOTIVATION: Sequence analysis is arguably a foundation of modern biology. Classic approaches to sequence analysis are based on sequence alignment, which is limited when dealing with large-scale sequence data. A dozen of alignment-free approaches have been developed to provide computationally efficient alternatives to alignment-based approaches. However, existing methods define sequence similarity based on various heuristics and can only provide rough approximations to alignment distances.
RESULTS: In this article, we developed a new approach, referred to as SENSE (SiamEse Neural network for Sequence Embedding), for efficient and accurate alignment-free sequence comparison. The basic idea is to use a deep neural network to learn an explicit embedding function based on a small training dataset to project sequences into an embedding space so that the mean square error between alignment distances and pairwise distances defined in the embedding space is minimized. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to use deep learning for alignment-free sequence analysis. A large-scale experiment was performed that demonstrated that our method significantly outperformed the state-of-the-art alignment-free methods in terms of both efficiency and accuracy.
AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: Open-source software for the proposed method is developed and freely available at https://www.acsu.buffalo.edu/∼yijunsun/lab/SENSE.html.

Deep learning approach for survival prediction for patients with synovial sarcoma,other,neural network,"Synovial sarcoma is a rare disease with diverse progression characteristics. We developed a novel deep-learning-based prediction algorithm for survival rates of synovial sarcoma patients. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the performance of the proposed prediction model and demonstrate its clinical usage. The study involved 242 patients who were diagnosed with synovial sarcoma in three institutions between March 2001 and February 2013. The patients were randomly divided into a training set (80%) and a testing set (20%). Fivefold cross validation was performed utilizing the training set. The test set was retained for the final testing. A Cox proportional hazard model, simple neural network, and the proposed survival neural network were all trained utilizing the same training set, and fivefold cross validation was performed. The final testing was performed utilizing the isolated test data to determine the best prediction model. The multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression analysis revealed that size, initial metastasis, and margin were independent prognostic factors. In fivefold cross validation, the median value of the receiver-operating characteristic curve (area under the curve) was 0.87 in the survival neural network, which is significantly higher compared to the area under the curve of 0.792 for the simple neural network (p = 0.043). In the final test, survival neural network model showed the better performance (area under the curve: 0.814) compared to the Cox proportional hazard model (area under the curve: 0.629; p = 0.0001). The survival neural network model predicted survival of synovial sarcoma patients more accurately compared to Cox proportional hazard model."
Predicting hospital readmission for lupus patients: An RNN-LSTM-based deep-learning methodology,other,"neural network, artificial neural network, recurrent neural network","Hospital readmission is one of the critical metrics used for measuring the performance of hospitals. The HITECH Act imposes penalties when patients are readmitted to hospitals if they are diagnosed with one of the six conditions mentioned in the Act. However, patients diagnosed with lupus are the sixth highest in terms of rehospitalization. The heterogeneity in the disease and patient characteristics makes it very hard to predict rehospitalization. This research utilizes deep learning methods to predict rehospitalization within 30 days by extracting the temporal relationships in the longitudinal EHR clinical data. Prediction results from deep learning methods such as LSTM are evaluated and compared with traditional classification methods such as penalized logistic regression and artificial neural networks. The simple recurrent neural network method and its variant, gated recurrent unit network, are also developed and validated to compare their performance against the proposed LSTM model. The results indicated that the deep learning method RNN-LSTM has a significantly better performance (with an AUC of .70) compared to traditional classification methods such as ANN (with an AUC of 0.66) and penalized logistic regression (with an AUC of 0.63). The rationale for the better performance of the deep learning method may be due to its ability to leverage the temporal relationships of the disease state in patients over time and to capture the progression of the disease-relevant clinical information from patients' prior visits is carried forward in the memory, which may have enabled the higher predictability for the deep learning methods."
Probabilistic Prognostic Estimates of Survival in Metastatic Cancer Patients (PPES-Met) Utilizing Free-Text Clinical Narratives,other,"neural network, recurrent neural network","We propose a deep learning model - Probabilistic Prognostic Estimates of Survival in Metastatic Cancer Patients (PPES-Met) for estimating short-term life expectancy (>3 months) of the patients by analyzing free-text clinical notes in the electronic medical record, while maintaining the temporal visit sequence. In a single framework, we integrated semantic data mapping and neural embedding technique to produce a text processing method that extracts relevant information from heterogeneous types of clinical notes in an unsupervised manner, and we designed a recurrent neural network to model the temporal dependency of the patient visits. The model was trained on a large dataset (10,293 patients) and validated on a separated dataset (1818 patients). Our method achieved an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.89. To provide explain-ability, we developed an interactive graphical tool that may improve physician understanding of the basis for the model's predictions. The high accuracy and explain-ability of the PPES-Met model may enable our model to be used as a decision support tool to personalize metastatic cancer treatment and provide valuable assistance to the physicians."
Development and Validation of a Deep Neural Network Model for Prediction of Postoperative In-hospital Mortality,other,neural network,"WHAT WE ALREADY KNOW ABOUT THIS TOPIC: WHAT THIS ARTICLE TELLS US THAT IS NEW: BACKGROUND:: The authors tested the hypothesis that deep neural networks trained on intraoperative features can predict postoperative in-hospital mortality.
METHODS: The data used to train and validate the algorithm consists of 59,985 patients with 87 features extracted at the end of surgery. Feed-forward networks with a logistic output were trained using stochastic gradient descent with momentum. The deep neural networks were trained on 80% of the data, with 20% reserved for testing. The authors assessed improvement of the deep neural network by adding American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) Physical Status Classification and robustness of the deep neural network to a reduced feature set. The networks were then compared to ASA Physical Status, logistic regression, and other published clinical scores including the Surgical Apgar, Preoperative Score to Predict Postoperative Mortality, Risk Quantification Index, and the Risk Stratification Index.
RESULTS: In-hospital mortality in the training and test sets were 0.81% and 0.73%. The deep neural network with a reduced feature set and ASA Physical Status classification had the highest area under the receiver operating characteristics curve, 0.91 (95% CI, 0.88 to 0.93). The highest logistic regression area under the curve was found with a reduced feature set and ASA Physical Status (0.90, 95% CI, 0.87 to 0.93). The Risk Stratification Index had the highest area under the receiver operating characteristics curve, at 0.97 (95% CI, 0.94 to 0.99).
CONCLUSIONS: Deep neural networks can predict in-hospital mortality based on automatically extractable intraoperative data, but are not (yet) superior to existing methods."
A Risk Stratification Model for Lung Cancer Based on Gene Coexpression Network and Deep Learning,other,None,"Risk stratification model for lung cancer with gene expression profile is of great interest. Instead of previous models based on individual prognostic genes, we aimed to develop a novel system-level risk stratification model for lung adenocarcinoma based on gene coexpression network. Using multiple microarray, gene coexpression network analysis was performed to identify survival-related networks. A deep learning based risk stratification model was constructed with representative genes of these networks. The model was validated in two test sets. Survival analysis was performed using the output of the model to evaluate whether it could predict patients' survival independent of clinicopathological variables. Five networks were significantly associated with patients' survival. Considering prognostic significance and representativeness, genes of the two survival-related networks were selected for input of the model. The output of the model was significantly associated with patients' survival in two test sets and training set (p &lt; 0.00001, p &lt; 0.0001 and p = 0.02 for training and test sets 1 and 2, resp.). In multivariate analyses, the model was associated with patients' prognosis independent of other clinicopathological features. Our study presents a new perspective on incorporating gene coexpression networks into the gene expression signature and clinical application of deep learning in genomic data science for prognosis prediction."
Hierarchical attention networks for information extraction from cancer pathology reports,other,"neural network, convolutional neural network, recurrent neural network","OBJECTIVE: We explored how a deep learning (DL) approach based on hierarchical attention networks (HANs) can improve model performance for multiple information extraction tasks from unstructured cancer pathology reports compared to conventional methods that do not sufﬁciently capture syntactic and semantic contexts from free-text documents.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data for our analyses were obtained from 942 deidentiﬁed pathology reports collected by the National Cancer Institute Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program. The HAN was implemented for 2 information extraction tasks: (1) primary site, matched to 12 International Classification of Diseases for Oncology topography codes (7 breast, 5 lung primary sites), and (2) histological grade classiﬁcation, matched to G1-G4. Model performance metrics were compared to conventional machine learning (ML) approaches including naive Bayes, logistic regression, support vector machine, random forest, and extreme gradient boosting, and other DL models, including a recurrent neural network (RNN), a recurrent neural network with attention (RNN w/A), and a convolutional neural network.
RESULTS: Our results demonstrate that for both information tasks, HAN performed signiﬁcantly better compared to the conventional ML and DL techniques. In particular, across the 2 tasks, the mean micro and macro F-scores for the HAN with pretraining were (0.852,0.708), compared to naive Bayes (0.518, 0.213), logistic regression (0.682, 0.453), support vector machine (0.634, 0.434), random forest (0.698, 0.508), extreme gradient boosting (0.696, 0.522), RNN (0.505, 0.301), RNN w/A (0.637, 0.471), and convolutional neural network (0.714, 0.460).
CONCLUSIONS: HAN-based DL models show promise in information abstraction tasks within unstructured clinical pathology reports."
A comparative study on predicting influenza outbreaks,other,"neural network, artificial neural network, machine learning model","Worldwide, influenza is estimated to result in approximately 3 to 5 million annual cases of severe illness and approximately 250,000 to 500,000 deaths. We need an accurate time-series model to predict the number of influenza patients. Although time-series models with different time lags as feature spaces could lead to varied accuracy, past studies simply adopted a time lag in their models without comparing or selecting an appropriate number of time lags. We investigated the performance of adopting 6 different time lags in 6 different models: Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), Support Vector Regression (SVR), Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boosting (GB), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) with hyperparameter adjustment. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that LSTM has been used to predict influenza outbreaks. As a result, we found that the time lag of 52 weeks led to the lowest Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) in the ARIMA, ANN and LSTM, while the machine learning models (SVR, RF, GB) achieved the lowest MAPEs with a time lag of 4 weeks. We also found that the MAPEs of the machine learning models were less than ARIMA, and the MAPEs of the deep learning models (ANN, LSTM) were less than those of the machine learning models. In all the models, the LSTM model of 4 layers reached the lowest MAPE of 5.4%, and the LSTM model of 5 layers with regularization reached the lowest root mean squared error (RMSE) of 0.00210."
SimNest: Social Media Nested Epidemic Simulation via Online Semi-supervised Deep Learning,other,None,"Infectious disease epidemics such as influenza and Ebola pose a serious threat to global public health. It is crucial to characterize the disease and the evolution of the ongoing epidemic efficiently and accurately. Computational epidemiology can model the disease progress and underlying contact network, but suffers from the lack of real-time and fine-grained surveillance data. Social media, on the other hand, provides timely and detailed disease surveillance, but is insensible to the underlying contact network and disease model. This paper proposes a novel semi-supervised deep learning framework that integrates the strengths of computational epidemiology and social media mining techniques. Specifically, this framework learns the social media users' health states and intervention actions in real time, which are regularized by the underlying disease model and contact network. Conversely, the learned knowledge from social media can be fed into computational epidemic model to improve the efficiency and accuracy of disease diffusion modeling. We propose an online optimization algorithm to substantialize the above interactive learning process iteratively to achieve a consistent stage of the integration. The extensive experimental results demonstrated that our approach can effectively characterize the spatio-temporal disease diffusion, outperforming competing methods by a substantial margin on multiple metrics."
Generative artificial intelligence performs rudimentary structural biology modeling,other,None,"Natural language-based generative artificial intelligence (AI) has become increasingly prevalent in scientific research. Intriguingly, capabilities of generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) language models beyond the scope of natural language tasks have recently been identified. Here we explored how GPT-4 might be able to perform rudimentary structural biology modeling. We prompted GPT-4 to model 3D structures for the 20 standard amino acids and an α-helical polypeptide chain, with the latter incorporating Wolfram mathematical computation. We also used GPT-4 to perform structural interaction analysis between the anti-viral nirmatrelvir and its target, the SARS-CoV-2 main protease. Geometric parameters of the generated structures typically approximated close to experimental references. However, modeling was sporadically error-prone and molecular complexity was not well tolerated. Interaction analysis further revealed the ability of GPT-4 to identify specific amino acid residues involved in ligand binding along with corresponding bond distances. Despite current limitations, we show the current capacity of natural language generative AI to perform basic structural biology modeling and interaction analysis with atomic-scale accuracy."
Optimizing Rare Disease Gait Classification through Data Balancing and Generative AI: Insights from Hereditary Cerebellar Ataxia,other,None,"The interpretability of gait analysis studies in people with rare diseases, such as those with primary hereditary cerebellar ataxia (pwCA), is frequently limited by the small sample sizes and unbalanced datasets. The purpose of this study was to assess the effectiveness of data balancing and generative artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms in generating synthetic data reflecting the actual gait abnormalities of pwCA. Gait data of 30 pwCA (age: 51.6 ± 12.2 years; 13 females, 17 males) and 100 healthy subjects (age: 57.1 ± 10.4; 60 females, 40 males) were collected at the lumbar level with an inertial measurement unit. Subsampling, oversampling, synthetic minority oversampling, generative adversarial networks, and conditional tabular generative adversarial networks (ctGAN) were applied to generate datasets to be input to a random forest classifier. Consistency and explainability metrics were also calculated to assess the coherence of the generated dataset with known gait abnormalities of pwCA. ctGAN significantly improved the classification performance compared with the original dataset and traditional data augmentation methods. ctGAN are effective methods for balancing tabular datasets from populations with rare diseases, owing to their ability to improve diagnostic models with consistent explainability."
Creating High-Quality Synthetic Health Data: Framework for Model Development and Validation,other,None,"BACKGROUND: Electronic health records are a valuable source of patient information that must be properly deidentified before being shared with researchers. This process requires expertise and time. In addition, synthetic data have considerably reduced the restrictions on the use and sharing of real data, allowing researchers to access it more rapidly with far fewer privacy constraints. Therefore, there has been a growing interest in establishing a method to generate synthetic data that protects patients' privacy while properly reflecting the data.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to develop and validate a model that generates valuable synthetic longitudinal health data while protecting the privacy of the patients whose data are collected.
METHODS: We investigated the best model for generating synthetic health data, with a focus on longitudinal observations. We developed a generative model that relies on the generalized canonical polyadic (GCP) tensor decomposition. This model also involves sampling from a latent factor matrix of GCP decomposition, which contains patient factors, using sequential decision trees, copula, and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo methods. We applied the proposed model to samples from the MIMIC-III (version 1.4) data set. Numerous analyses and experiments were conducted with different data structures and scenarios. We assessed the similarity between our synthetic data and the real data by conducting utility assessments. These assessments evaluate the structure and general patterns present in the data, such as dependency structure, descriptive statistics, and marginal distributions. Regarding privacy disclosure, our model preserves privacy by preventing the direct sharing of patient information and eliminating the one-to-one link between the observed and model tensor records. This was achieved by simulating and modeling a latent factor matrix of GCP decomposition associated with patients.
RESULTS: The findings show that our model is a promising method for generating synthetic longitudinal health data that is similar enough to real data. It can preserve the utility and privacy of the original data while also handling various data structures and scenarios. In certain experiments, all simulation methods used in the model produced the same high level of performance. Our model is also capable of addressing the challenge of sampling patients from electronic health records. This means that we can simulate a variety of patients in the synthetic data set, which may differ in number from the patients in the original data.
CONCLUSIONS: We have presented a generative model for producing synthetic longitudinal health data. The model is formulated by applying the GCP tensor decomposition. We have provided 3 approaches for the synthesis and simulation of a latent factor matrix following the process of factorization. In brief, we have reduced the challenge of synthesizing massive longitudinal health data to synthesizing a nonlongitudinal and significantly smaller data set."
Leveraging generative AI for clinical evidence synthesis needs to ensure trustworthiness,other,None,"Evidence-based medicine promises to improve the quality of healthcare by empowering medical decisions and practices with the best available evidence. The rapid growth of medical evidence, which can be obtained from various sources, poses a challenge in collecting, appraising, and synthesizing the evidential information. Recent advancements in generative AI, exemplified by large language models, hold promise in facilitating the arduous task. However, developing accountable, fair, and inclusive models remains a complicated undertaking. In this perspective, we discuss the trustworthiness of generative AI in the context of automated summarization of medical evidence."
Search still matters: information retrieval in the era of generative AI,other,None,"OBJECTIVE: Information retrieval (IR, also known as search) systems are ubiquitous in modern times. How does the emergence of generative artificial intelligence (AI), based on large language models (LLMs), fit into the IR process?
PROCESS: This perspective explores the use of generative AI in the context of the motivations, considerations, and outcomes of the IR process with a focus on the academic use of such systems.
CONCLUSIONS: There are many information needs, from simple to complex, that motivate use of IR. Users of such systems, particularly academics, have concerns for authoritativeness, timeliness, and contextualization of search. While LLMs may provide functionality that aids the IR process, the continued need for search systems, and research into their improvement, remains essential."
All aboard the ChatGPT steamroller: Top 10 ways to make artificial intelligence work for healthcare professionals,other,None,"Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer (ChatGPT), the flagship generative artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot by OpenAI, is transforming many things in medicine, from healthcare and research to medical education. It is anticipated to integrate in many aspects of the medical industry, and we should brace for this inevitability and use it to our advantage. Here are proposed ways you can use ChatGPT in medicine with some specific use cases in antimicrobial stewardship and hospital epidemiology."
Evaluating the Utility and Privacy of Synthetic Breast Cancer Clinical Trial Data Sets,other,None,"PURPOSE: There is strong interest from patients, researchers, the pharmaceutical industry, medical journal editors, funders of research, and regulators in sharing clinical trial data for secondary analysis. However, data access remains a challenge because of concerns about patient privacy. It has been argued that synthetic data generation (SDG) is an effective way to address these privacy concerns. There is a dearth of evidence supporting this on oncology clinical trial data sets, and on the utility of privacy-preserving synthetic data. The objective of the proposed study is to validate the utility and privacy risks of synthetic clinical trial data sets across multiple SDG techniques.
METHODS: We synthesized data sets from eight breast cancer clinical trial data sets using three types of generative models: sequential synthesis, conditional generative adversarial network, and variational autoencoder. Synthetic data utility was evaluated by replicating the published analyses on the synthetic data and assessing concordance of effect estimates and CIs between real and synthetic data. Privacy was evaluated by measuring attribution disclosure risk and membership disclosure risk.
RESULTS: Utility was highest using the sequential synthesis method where all results were replicable and the CI overlap most similar or higher for seven of eight data sets. Both types of privacy risks were low across all three types of generative models.
DISCUSSION: Synthetic data using sequential synthesis methods can act as a proxy for real clinical trial data sets, and simultaneously have low privacy risks. This type of generative model can be one way to enable broader sharing of clinical trial data."

The importance of transparency: Declaring the use of generative artificial intelligence (AI) in academic writing,other,None,"The integration of generative artificial intelligence (AI) into academic research writing has revolutionized the field, offering powerful tools like ChatGPT and Bard to aid researchers in content generation and idea enhancement. We explore the current state of transparency regarding generative AI use in nursing academic research journals, emphasizing the need for explicitly declaring the use of generative AI by authors in the manuscript. Out of 125 nursing studies journals, 37.6% required explicit statements about generative AI use in their authors' guidelines. No significant differences in impact factors or journal categories were found between journals with and without such requirement. A similar evaluation of medicine, general and internal journals showed a lower percentage (14.5%) including the information about generative AI usage. Declaring generative AI tool usage is crucial for maintaining the transparency and credibility in academic writing. Additionally, extending the requirement for AI usage declarations to journal reviewers can enhance the quality of peer review and combat predatory journals in the academic publishing landscape. Our study highlights the need for active participation from nursing researchers in discussions surrounding standardization of generative AI declaration in academic research writing."
ADuLT: An efficient and robust time-to-event GWAS,other,None,"Proportional hazards models have been proposed to analyse time-to-event phenotypes in genome-wide association studies (GWAS). However, little is known about the ability of proportional hazards models to identify genetic associations under different generative models and when ascertainment is present. Here we propose the age-dependent liability threshold (ADuLT) model as an alternative to a Cox regression based GWAS, here represented by SPACox. We compare ADuLT, SPACox, and standard case-control GWAS in simulations under two generative models and with varying degrees of ascertainment as well as in the iPSYCH cohort. We find Cox regression GWAS to be underpowered when cases are strongly ascertained (cases are oversampled by a factor 5), regardless of the generative model used. ADuLT is robust to ascertainment in all simulated scenarios. Then, we analyse four psychiatric disorders in iPSYCH, ADHD, Autism, Depression, and Schizophrenia, with a strong case-ascertainment. Across these psychiatric disorders, ADuLT identifies 20 independent genome-wide significant associations, case-control GWAS finds 17, and SPACox finds 8, which is consistent with simulation results. As more genetic data are being linked to electronic health records, robust GWAS methods that can make use of age-of-onset information will help increase power in analyses for common health outcomes."
Information extraction from medical case reports using OpenAI InstructGPT,text mining,None,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Researchers commonly use automated solutions such as Natural Language Processing (NLP) systems to extract clinical information from large volumes of unstructured data. However, clinical text's poor semantic structure and domain-specific vocabulary can make it challenging to develop a one-size-fits-all solution. Large Language Models (LLMs), such as OpenAI's Generative Pre-Trained Transformer 3 (GPT-3), offer a promising solution for capturing and standardizing unstructured clinical information. This study evaluated the performance of InstructGPT, a family of models derived from LLM GPT-3, to extract relevant patient information from medical case reports and discussed the advantages and disadvantages of LLMs versus dedicated NLP methods.
METHODS: In this paper, 208 articles related to case reports of foreign body injuries in children were identified by searching PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science. A reviewer manually extracted information on sex, age, the object that caused the injury, and the injured body part for each patient to build a gold standard to compare the performance of InstructGPT.
RESULTS: InstructGPT achieved high accuracy in classifying the sex, age, object and body part involved in the injury, with 94%, 82%, 94% and 89%, respectively. When excluding articles for which InstructGPT could not retrieve any information, the accuracy for determining the child's sex and age improved to 97%, and the accuracy for identifying the injured body part improved to 93%. InstructGPT was also able to extract information from non-English language articles.
CONCLUSIONS: The study highlights that LLMs have the potential to eliminate the necessity for task-specific training (zero-shot extraction), allowing the retrieval of clinical information from unstructured natural language text, particularly from published scientific literature like case reports, by directly utilizing the PDF file of the article without any pre-processing and without requiring any technical expertise in NLP or Machine Learning. The diverse nature of the corpus, which includes articles written in languages other than English, some of which contain a wide range of clinical details while others lack information, adds to the strength of the study."
Understanding the vaccine stance of Italian tweets and addressing language changes through the COVID-19 pandemic: Development and validation of a machine learning model,other,machine learning model,"Social media is increasingly being used to express opinions and attitudes toward vaccines. The vaccine stance of social media posts can be classified in almost real-time using machine learning. We describe the use of a Transformer-based machine learning model for analyzing vaccine stance of Italian tweets, and demonstrate the need to address changes over time in vaccine-related language, through periodic model retraining. Vaccine-related tweets were collected through a platform developed for the European Joint Action on Vaccination. Two datasets were collected, the first between November 2019 and June 2020, the second from April to September 2021. The tweets were manually categorized by three independent annotators. After cleaning, the total dataset consisted of 1,736 tweets with 3 categories (promotional, neutral, and discouraging). The manually classified tweets were used to train and test various machine learning models. The model that classified the data most similarly to humans was XLM-Roberta-large, a multilingual version of the Transformer-based model RoBERTa. The model hyper-parameters were tuned and then the model ran five times. The fine-tuned model with the best F-score over the validation dataset was selected. Running the selected fine-tuned model on just the first test dataset resulted in an accuracy of 72.8% (F-score 0.713). Using this model on the second test dataset resulted in a 10% drop in accuracy to 62.1% (F-score 0.617), indicating that the model recognized a difference in language between the datasets. On the combined test datasets the accuracy was 70.1% (F-score 0.689). Retraining the model using data from the first and second datasets increased the accuracy over the second test dataset to 71.3% (F-score 0.713), a 9% improvement from when using just the first dataset for training. The accuracy over the first test dataset remained the same at 72.8% (F-score 0.721). The accuracy over the combined test datasets was then 72.4% (F-score 0.720), a 2% improvement. Through fine-tuning a machine-learning model on task-specific data, the accuracy achieved in categorizing tweets was close to that expected by a single human annotator. Regular training of machine-learning models with recent data is advisable to maximize accuracy."
Comparison of the performance of log-logistic regression and artificial neural networks for predicting breast cancer relapse,other,"neural network, artificial neural network","BACKGROUND: Breast cancer is the most common cancers in female populations. The exact cause is not known, but is most likely to be a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Log-logistic model (LLM) is applied as a statistical method for predicting survival and it influencing factors. In recent decades, artificial neural network (ANN) models have been increasingly applied to predict survival data. The present research was conducted to compare log-logistic regression and artificial neural network models in prediction of breast cancer (BC) survival.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A historical cohort study was established with 104 patients suffering from BC from 1997 to 2005. To compare the ANN and LLM in our setting, we used the estimated areas under the receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) and integrated AUC (iAUC). The data were analyzed using R statistical software.
RESULTS: The AUC for the first, second and third years after diagnosis are 0.918, 0.780 and 0.800 in ANN, and 0.834, 0.733 and 0.616 in LLM, respectively. The mean AUC for ANN was statistically higher than that of the LLM (0.845 vs. 0.744). Hence, this study showed a significant difference between the performance in terms of prediction by ANN and LLM.
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that the ability of prediction with ANN was higher than with the LLM model. Thus, the use of ANN method for prediction of survival in field of breast cancer is suggested."
Assessing the utility of natural language processing for detecting postoperative complications from free medical text,text mining,None,"BACKGROUND: Postoperative complication rates are often assessed through administrative data, although this method has proven to be imprecise. Recently, new developments in natural language processing have shown promise in detecting specific phenotypes from free medical text. Using the clinical challenge of extracting four specific and frequently undercoded postoperative complications (pneumonia, urinary tract infection, sepsis, and septic shock), it was hypothesized that natural language processing would capture postoperative complications on a par with human-level curation from electronic health record free medical text.
METHODS: Electronic health record data were extracted for surgical cases (across 11 surgical sub-specialties) from 18 hospitals in the Capital and Zealand regions of Denmark that were performed between May 2016 and November 2021. The data set was split into training/validation/test sets (30.0%/48.0%/22.0%). Model performance was compared with administrative data and manual extraction of the test data set.
RESULTS: Data were obtained for 17 486 surgical cases. Natural language processing achieved a receiver operating characteristic area under the curve of 0.989 for urinary tract infection, 0.993 for pneumonia, 0.992 for sepsis, and 0.998 for septic shock, whereas administrative data achieved a receiver operating characteristic area under the curve of 0.595 for urinary tract infection, 0.624 for pneumonia, 0.571 for sepsis, and 0.625 for septic shock.
CONCLUSION: The natural language processing approach was able to capture complications with acceptable performance, which was superior to administrative data. In addition, the model performance approached that of manual curation and thereby offers a potential pathway for complete real-time coverage of postoperative complications across surgical procedures based on natural language processing assessment of electronic health record free medical text."
Predicting Depression Risk in Patients With Cancer Using Multimodal Data: Algorithm Development Study,text mining,machine learning model,"BACKGROUND: Patients with cancer starting systemic treatment programs, such as chemotherapy, often develop depression. A prediction model may assist physicians and health care workers in the early identification of these vulnerable patients.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to develop a prediction model for depression risk within the first month of cancer treatment.
METHODS: We included 16,159 patients diagnosed with cancer starting chemo- or radiotherapy treatment between 2008 and 2021. Machine learning models (eg, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator [LASSO] logistic regression) and natural language processing models (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers [BERT]) were used to develop multimodal prediction models using both electronic health record data and unstructured text (patient emails and clinician notes). Model performance was assessed in an independent test set (n=5387, 33%) using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), calibration curves, and decision curve analysis to assess initial clinical impact use.
RESULTS: Among 16,159 patients, 437 (2.7%) received a depression diagnosis within the first month of treatment. The LASSO logistic regression models based on the structured data (AUROC 0.74, 95% CI 0.71-0.78) and structured data with email classification scores (AUROC 0.74, 95% CI 0.71-0.78) had the best discriminative performance. The BERT models based on clinician notes and structured data with email classification scores had AUROCs around 0.71. The logistic regression model based on email classification scores alone performed poorly (AUROC 0.54, 95% CI 0.52-0.56), and the model based solely on clinician notes had the worst performance (AUROC 0.50, 95% CI 0.49-0.52). Calibration was good for the logistic regression models, whereas the BERT models produced overly extreme risk estimates even after recalibration. There was a small range of decision thresholds for which the best-performing model showed promising clinical effectiveness use. The risks were underestimated for female and Black patients.
CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrated the potential and limitations of machine learning and multimodal models for predicting depression risk in patients with cancer. Future research is needed to further validate these models, refine the outcome label and predictors related to mental health, and address biases across subgroups."
Multimodal fine-tuning of clinical language models for predicting COVID-19 outcomes,other,None,"Clinical prediction models tend only to incorporate structured healthcare data, ignoring information recorded in other data modalities, including free-text clinical notes. Here, we demonstrate how multimodal models that effectively leverage both structured and unstructured data can be developed for predicting COVID-19 outcomes. The models are trained end-to-end using a technique we refer to as multimodal fine-tuning, whereby a pre-trained language model is updated based on both structured and unstructured data. The multimodal models are trained and evaluated using a multicenter cohort of COVID-19 patients encompassing all encounters at the emergency department of six hospitals. Experimental results show that multimodal models, leveraging the notion of multimodal fine-tuning and trained to predict (i) 30-day mortality, (ii) safe discharge and (iii) readmission, outperform unimodal models trained using only structured or unstructured healthcare data on all three outcomes. Sensitivity analyses are performed to better understand how well the multimodal models perform on different patient groups, while an ablation study is conducted to investigate the impact of different types of clinical notes on model performance. We argue that multimodal models that make effective use of routinely collected healthcare data to predict COVID-19 outcomes may facilitate patient management and contribute to the effective use of limited healthcare resources."
Finding Asymptomatic Spreaders in a COVID-19 Transmission Network by Graph Attention Networks,text mining,None,"In the COVID-19 epidemic the mildly symptomatic and asymptomatic infections generate a substantial portion of virus spread; these undetected individuals make it difficult to assess the effectiveness of preventive measures as most epidemic prevention strategies are based on the detected data. Effectively identifying the undetected infections in local transmission will be of great help in COVID-19 control. In this work, we propose an RNA virus transmission network representation model based on graph attention networks (RVTR); this model is constructed using the principle of natural language processing to learn the information of gene sequence and using a graph attention network to catch the topological character of COVID-19 transmission networks. Since SARS-CoV-2 will mutate when it spreads, our approach makes use of graph context loss function, which can reflect that the genetic sequence of infections with close spreading relation will be more similar than those with a long distance, to train our model. Our approach shows its ability to find asymptomatic spreaders both on simulated and real COVID-19 datasets and performs better when compared with other network representation and feature extraction methods."
Automated model versus treating physician for predicting survival time of patients with metastatic cancer,other,machine learning model,"OBJECTIVE: Being able to predict a patient's life expectancy can help doctors and patients prioritize treatments and supportive care. For predicting life expectancy, physicians have been shown to outperform traditional models that use only a few predictor variables. It is possible that a machine learning model that uses many predictor variables and diverse data sources from the electronic medical record can improve on physicians' performance. For patients with metastatic cancer, we compared accuracy of life expectancy predictions by the treating physician, a machine learning model, and a traditional model.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A machine learning model was trained using 14 600 metastatic cancer patients' data to predict each patient's distribution of survival time. Data sources included note text, laboratory values, and vital signs. From 2015-2016, 899 patients receiving radiotherapy for metastatic cancer were enrolled in a study in which their radiation oncologist estimated life expectancy. Survival predictions were also made by the machine learning model and a traditional model using only performance status. Performance was assessed with area under the curve for 1-year survival and calibration plots.
RESULTS: The radiotherapy study included 1190 treatment courses in 899 patients. A total of 879 treatment courses in 685 patients were included in this analysis. Median overall survival was 11.7 months. Physicians, machine learning model, and traditional model had area under the curve for 1-year survival of 0.72 (95% CI 0.63-0.81), 0.77 (0.73-0.81), and 0.68 (0.65-0.71), respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: The machine learning model's predictions were more accurate than those of the treating physician or a traditional model."
Self-Supervised Contextual Language Representation of Radiology Reports to Improve the Identification of Communication Urgency,text mining,None,"Machine learning methods have recently achieved high-performance in biomedical text analysis. However, a major bottleneck in the widespread application of these methods is obtaining the required large amounts of annotated training data, which is resource intensive and time consuming. Recent progress in self-supervised learning has shown promise in leveraging large text corpora without explicit annotations. In this work, we built a self-supervised contextual language representation model using BERT, a deep bidirectional transformer architecture, to identify radiology reports requiring prompt communication to the referring physicians. We pre-trained the BERT model on a large unlabeled corpus of radiology reports and used the resulting contextual representations in a final text classifier for communication urgency. Our model achieved a precision of 97.0%, recall of 93.3%, and F-measure of 95.1% on an independent test set in identifying radiology reports for prompt communication, and significantly outperformed the previous state-of-the-art model based on word2vec representations."
Natural Language Processing for Surveillance of Cervical and Anal Cancer and Precancer: Algorithm Development and Split-Validation Study,text mining,None,"BACKGROUND: Accurate identification of new diagnoses of human papillomavirus-associated cancers and precancers is an important step toward the development of strategies that optimize the use of human papillomavirus vaccines. The diagnosis of human papillomavirus cancers hinges on a histopathologic report, which is typically stored in electronic medical records as free-form, or unstructured, narrative text. Previous efforts to perform surveillance for human papillomavirus cancers have relied on the manual review of pathology reports to extract diagnostic information, a process that is both labor- and resource-intensive. Natural language processing can be used to automate the structuring and extraction of clinical data from unstructured narrative text in medical records and may provide a practical and effective method for identifying patients with vaccine-preventable human papillomavirus disease for surveillance and research.
OBJECTIVE: This study's objective was to develop and assess the accuracy of a natural language processing algorithm for the identification of individuals with cancer or precancer of the cervix and anus.
METHODS: A pipeline-based natural language processing algorithm was developed, which incorporated machine learning and rule-based methods to extract diagnostic elements from the narrative pathology reports. To test the algorithm's classification accuracy, we used a split-validation study design. Full-length cervical and anal pathology reports were randomly selected from 4 clinical pathology laboratories. Two study team members, blinded to the classifications produced by the natural language processing algorithm, manually and independently reviewed all reports and classified them at the document level according to 2 domains (diagnosis and human papillomavirus testing results). Using the manual review as the gold standard, the algorithm's performance was evaluated using standard measurements of accuracy, recall, precision, and F-measure.
RESULTS: The natural language processing algorithm's performance was validated on 949 pathology reports. The algorithm demonstrated accurate identification of abnormal cytology, histology, and positive human papillomavirus tests with accuracies greater than 0.91. Precision was lowest for anal histology reports (0.87, 95% CI 0.59-0.98) and highest for cervical cytology (0.98, 95% CI 0.95-0.99). The natural language processing algorithm missed 2 out of the 15 abnormal anal histology reports, which led to a relatively low recall (0.68, 95% CI 0.43-0.87).
CONCLUSIONS: This study outlines the development and validation of a freely available and easily implementable natural language processing algorithm that can automate the extraction and classification of clinical data from cervical and anal cytology and histology."
Predicting COVID-19 in China Using Hybrid AI Model,text mining,None,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) breaking out in late December 2019 is gradually being controlled in China, but it is still spreading rapidly in many other countries and regions worldwide. It is urgent to conduct prediction research on the development and spread of the epidemic. In this article, a hybrid artificial-intelligence (AI) model is proposed for COVID-19 prediction. First, as traditional epidemic models treat all individuals with coronavirus as having the same infection rate, an improved susceptible-infected (ISI) model is proposed to estimate the variety of the infection rates for analyzing the transmission laws and development trend. Second, considering the effects of prevention and control measures and the increase of the public's prevention awareness, the natural language processing (NLP) module and the long short-term memory (LSTM) network are embedded into the ISI model to build the hybrid AI model for COVID-19 prediction. The experimental results on the epidemic data of several typical provinces and cities in China show that individuals with coronavirus have a higher infection rate within the third to eighth days after they were infected, which is more in line with the actual transmission laws of the epidemic. Moreover, compared with the traditional epidemic models, the proposed hybrid AI model can significantly reduce the errors of the prediction results and obtain the mean absolute percentage errors (MAPEs) with 0.52%, 0.38%, 0.05%, and 0.86% for the next six days in Wuhan, Beijing, Shanghai, and countrywide, respectively."
Artificial intelligence-assisted prediction of preeclampsia: Development and external validation of a nationwide health insurance dataset of the BPJS Kesehatan in Indonesia,text mining,None,"BACKGROUND: We developed and validated an artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted prediction of preeclampsia applied to a nationwide health insurance dataset in Indonesia.
METHODS: The BPJS Kesehatan dataset have been preprocessed using a nested case-control design into preeclampsia/eclampsia (n = 3318) and normotensive pregnant women (n = 19,883) from all women with one pregnancy. The dataset provided 95 features consisting of demographic variables and medical histories started from 24 months to event and ended by delivery as the event. Six algorithms were compared by area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUROC) with a subgroup analysis by time to the event. We compared our model to similar prediction models from systematically reviewed studies. In addition, we conducted a text mining analysis based on natural language processing techniques to interpret our modeling results.
FINDINGS: The best model consisted of 17 predictors extracted by a random forest algorithm. Nine∼12 months to the event was the period that had the best AUROC in external validation by either geographical (0.88, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.88-0.89) or temporal split (0.86, 95% CI 0.85-0.86). We compared this model to prediction models in seven studies from 869 records in PUBMED, EMBASE, and SCOPUS. This model outperformed the previous models in terms of the precision, sensitivity, and specificity in all validation sets.
INTERPRETATION: Our low-cost model improved preliminary prediction to decide pregnant women that will be predicted by the models with high specificity and advanced predictors.

Efficient Reuse of Natural Language Processing Models for Phenotype-Mention Identification in Free-text Electronic Medical Records: A Phenotype Embedding Approach,text mining,None,"BACKGROUND: Much effort has been put into the use of automated approaches, such as natural language processing (NLP), to mine or extract data from free-text medical records in order to construct comprehensive patient profiles for delivering better health care. Reusing NLP models in new settings, however, remains cumbersome, as it requires validation and retraining on new data iteratively to achieve convergent results.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this work is to minimize the effort involved in reusing NLP models on free-text medical records.
METHODS: We formally define and analyze the model adaptation problem in phenotype-mention identification tasks. We identify ""duplicate waste"" and ""imbalance waste,"" which collectively impede efficient model reuse. We propose a phenotype embedding-based approach to minimize these sources of waste without the need for labelled data from new settings.
RESULTS: We conduct experiments on data from a large mental health registry to reuse NLP models in four phenotype-mention identification tasks. The proposed approach can choose the best model for a new task, identifying up to 76% waste (duplicate waste), that is, phenotype mentions without the need for validation and model retraining and with very good performance (93%-97% accuracy). It can also provide guidance for validating and retraining the selected model for novel language patterns in new tasks, saving around 80% waste (imbalance waste), that is, the effort required in ""blind"" model-adaptation approaches.
CONCLUSIONS: Adapting pretrained NLP models for new tasks can be more efficient and effective if the language pattern landscapes of old settings and new settings can be made explicit and comparable. Our experiments show that the phenotype-mention embedding approach is an effective way to model language patterns for phenotype-mention identification tasks and that its use can guide efficient NLP model reuse."
A clinical text classification paradigm using weak supervision and deep representation,text mining,"neural network, machine learning model, multilayer perceptron, convolutional neural network","BACKGROUND: Automatic clinical text classification is a natural language processing (NLP) technology that unlocks information embedded in clinical narratives. Machine learning approaches have been shown to be effective for clinical text classification tasks. However, a successful machine learning model usually requires extensive human efforts to create labeled training data and conduct feature engineering. In this study, we propose a clinical text classification paradigm using weak supervision and deep representation to reduce these human efforts.
METHODS: We develop a rule-based NLP algorithm to automatically generate labels for the training data, and then use the pre-trained word embeddings as deep representation features for training machine learning models. Since machine learning is trained on labels generated by the automatic NLP algorithm, this training process is called weak supervision. We evaluat the paradigm effectiveness on two institutional case studies at Mayo Clinic: smoking status classification and proximal femur (hip) fracture classification, and one case study using a public dataset: the i2b2 2006 smoking status classification shared task. We test four widely used machine learning models, namely, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), Multilayer Perceptron Neural Networks (MLPNN), and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), using this paradigm. Precision, recall, and F1 score are used as metrics to evaluate performance.
RESULTS: CNN achieves the best performance in both institutional tasks (F1 score: 0.92 for Mayo Clinic smoking status classification and 0.97 for fracture classification). We show that word embeddings significantly outperform tf-idf and topic modeling features in the paradigm, and that CNN captures additional patterns from the weak supervision compared to the rule-based NLP algorithms. We also observe two drawbacks of the proposed paradigm that CNN is more sensitive to the size of training data, and that the proposed paradigm might not be effective for complex multiclass classification tasks.
CONCLUSION: The proposed clinical text classification paradigm could reduce human efforts of labeled training data creation and feature engineering for applying machine learning to clinical text classification by leveraging weak supervision and deep representation. The experimental experiments have validated the effectiveness of paradigm by two institutional and one shared clinical text classification tasks."
"A Novel Model for Predicting Rehospitalization Risk Incorporating Physical Function, Cognitive Status, and Psychosocial Support Using Natural Language Processing",text mining,None,"BACKGROUND: With the increasing focus on reducing hospital readmissions in the United States, numerous readmissions risk prediction models have been proposed, mostly developed through analyses of structured data fields in electronic medical records and administrative databases. Three areas that may have an impact on readmission but are poorly captured using structured data sources are patients' physical function, cognitive status, and psychosocial environment and support.
OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY: The objective of the study was to build a discriminative model using information germane to these 3 areas to identify hospitalized patients' risk for 30-day all cause readmissions.
RESEARCH DESIGN: We conducted clinician focus groups to identify language used in the clinical record regarding these 3 areas. We then created a dataset including 30,000 inpatients, 10,000 from each of 3 hospitals, and searched those records for the focus group-derived language using natural language processing. A 30-day readmission prediction model was developed on 75% of the dataset and validated on the other 25% and also on hospital specific subsets.
RESULTS: Focus group language was aggregated into 35 variables. The final model had 16 variables, a validated C-statistic of 0.74, and was well calibrated. Subset validation of the model by hospital yielded C-statistics of 0.70-0.75.
CONCLUSIONS: Deriving a 30-day readmission risk prediction model through identification of physical, cognitive, and psychosocial issues using natural language processing yielded a model that performs similarly to the better performing models previously published with the added advantage of being based on clinically relevant factors and also automated and scalable. Because of the clinical relevance of the variables in the model, future research may be able to test if targeting interventions to identified risks results in reductions in readmissions."
Language Ability Groups in Bilingual Children: A Latent Profile Analysis,text mining,None,"PURPOSE: Classifying children into two language ability groups, with and without language impairment, may underestimate the number of groups with distinct language ability patterns, or, alternatively, there may be only a single group characterized by a continuum of language performance. The purpose of the current study was to identify the number and characteristics of latent (unobservable) language ability groups in an unclassified sample of predominantly Spanish-speaking children.
METHOD: An unclassified sample of 431 predominantly Spanish-speaking 5- to 7-year-olds learning English participated in the study. The groups were identified on the basis of (a) language sample analyses (semantic, grammatical, and sentence-length measures); (b) language processing tasks (phonological working memory and processing speed measures); and (c) nonverbal cognitive abilities assessed using a standardized measure. All tasks were administered in Spanish. Latent profile analysis was used to examine the number and nature of distinct language ability groups in the unclassified sample.
RESULTS: Results indicated that a three-group model best represented the data, characterized by low grammaticality in one group, low phonological working memory in another group, and average skills in a third group.
CONCLUSION: Classifying children into two groups, those with and without language impairment, may lead to misidentification of language impairment."
Models of attention and dual-task performance as explanatory constructs in aphasia,text mining,None,"Aphasia has traditionally been viewed as a loss or impairment of language. However, evidence is presented suggesting that language mechanisms are fundamentally preserved and that aphasic language behaviors are instead due to impairments of cognitive processes supporting their construction. These processes may be understood as a linguistically specialized attentional system that is vulnerable to competition from other processing domains. We present two models of attention that focus on competition for central processing and discuss findings from dual-task studies of normal and aphasic performance. First, competing language and nonlanguage tasks appear to share limited-capacity, parallel processing resources. Second, aphasic individuals demonstrate slowed central processing that could be due to a reduction in processing capacity or ability to allocate that capacity. Third, the attention models discussed bear a coherent relationship to current models of language processing. Clinical implications of a cognitive processing account of aphasia are also considered."
Comparison of the recovery patterns of language and cognitive functions in patients with post-traumatic language processing deficits and in patients with aphasia following a stroke,text mining,None,"UNLABELLED: In this study we investigated the recovery patterns of language and cognitive functions in patients with post-traumatic language processing deficits and in patients with aphasia following a stroke. The correlation of specific language functions and cognitive functions was analyzed in the acute phase and 6 months later. Significant recovery of the tested functions was observed in both groups. However, in patients with post-traumatic language processing deficits the degree of recovery of most language functions and some cognitive functions was higher. A significantly greater correlation was revealed within language and cognitive functions, as well as between language functions and other aspects of cognition in patients with post-traumatic language processing deficits than in patients with aphasia following a stroke. Our results show that patients with post-traumatic language processing deficits have a different recovery pattern and a different pattern of correlation between language and cognitive functions compared to patients with aphasia following a stroke.
LEARNING OUTCOMES: (1) Better understanding of the differences in recovery of language and cognitive functions in patients who have suffered strokes and those who have experienced traumatic brain injury. (2) Better understanding of the relationship between language and cognitive functions in patients with post-traumatic language processing deficits and in patients with aphasia following a stroke. (3) Better understanding of the factors influencing recovery."
Bone lead levels and language processing performance,text mining,None,"The relation between bone lead absorption and language processing abilities in 156 randomly selected 11- to 14-year-old boys who were asymptomatic for lead toxicity is examined. Tibial lead concentrations were measured by X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy. The language processing outcome variables consisted of the least and most difficult subtests from the Nonword Repetition Task, Competing Language Processing Task, and the Revised Token Test. Participants were classified by quartiles according to bone lead concentrations, and analysis of variance and analysis of covariance measured the impact on language processing scores. Results showed that children in the highest bone lead quartile displayed decreased language processing performance on the most difficult language processing tasks but not on the easier tasks."
"On the linguistic representation of medical information: natural language, controlled language, and formal language",other,None,"Language is indispensable for the representation of medical information. We classified the methods of linguistic representation into three items: natural language, controlled language, and formal language. The characteristics of these are discussed; we focus especially on the preparation of data and data quality. We present the perspective that linguistic research in medical informatics can be considered as an effort to convert natural language into formal language and vice versa. The problems related to the conversion and the role of controlled language in medical linguistics are discussed in detail."
A Hybrid CNN-Transformer Model for Predicting N Staging and Survival in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Patients Based on CT-Scan,other,"neural network, convolutional neural network","Accurate assessment of N staging in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is critical for the development of effective treatment plans, the optimization of therapeutic strategies, and the enhancement of patient survival rates. This study proposes a hybrid model based on 3D convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transformers for predicting the N-staging and survival rates of NSCLC patients within the NSCLC radiogenomics and Nsclc-radiomics datasets. The model achieved accuracies of 0.805, 0.828, and 0.819 for the training, validation, and testing sets, respectively. By leveraging the strengths of CNNs in local feature extraction and the superior performance of transformers in global information modeling, the model significantly enhances predictive accuracy and efficacy. A comparative analysis with traditional CNN and transformer architectures demonstrates that the CNN-transformer hybrid model outperforms N-staging predictions. Furthermore, this study extracts the one-year survival rate as a feature and employs the Lasso-Cox model for survival predictions at various time intervals (1, 3, 5, and 7 years), with all survival prediction p-values being less than 0.05, illustrating the time-dependent nature of survival analysis. The application of time-dependent ROC curves further validates the model's accuracy and reliability for survival predictions. Overall, this research provides innovative methodologies and new insights for the early diagnosis and prognostic evaluation of NSCLC."
A besyian regularisation neural network approach for hepatitis B virus spread prediction and immune system therapy model,other,"neural network, artificial neural network","The primary aim of the article is to analyze the response of the human immune system when it encounters the hepatitis B virus. This is done using a mathematical system of differential equations. The differential equation system has six components, likely representing various aspects of the immune response or virus dynamics. A Bayesian regularization neural network has been presented in the process of training. These networks are employed to find solutions for different categories or scenarios related to hepatitis B infection. The Adams method is used to generate reference data sets. The back-propagated artificial neural network, based on Bayesian regularization, is trained and validated using the generated data. The data is divided into three sets: 90% for training and 5% each for testing and validation. The correctness and effectiveness of the proposed neural network model have been assessed using various evaluation metrics. The metrics have been used in this study are Mean Square Error (MSE), histogram errors, and regression plots. These measures provide support to the neural network to approximate the immune response to the hepatitis B virus."
A comprehensive analysis of the artificial neural networks model for predicting monkeypox outbreaks,other,"neural network, artificial neural network","Monkeypox is a viral disease that causes outbreaks in various countries, significantly impacting public health and healthcare systems. Effective preparedness and response efforts require accurately predicting the severity of these outbreaks. Currently, there are no publicly released studies for nations like Chile and Mexico on monkeypox, leading to this study's creation. We use a neural network model with a time series dataset of monkeypox cases from multiple countries, including Argentina, Brazil, France, Germany, Chile, and Mexico. The Levenberg-Marquardt learning technique is employed to develop and validate single and two hidden layers artificial neural network models. We train various model architectures with different numbers of hidden layer neurons using the K-fold cross-validation early stopping method. Additionally, we use long short-term memory and gated recurrent unit models, commonly employed for time series data processing, to compare the performance of our artificial neural network model."
A multimodal neural network with gradient blending improves predictions of survival and metastasis in sarcoma,other,neural network,"The objective of this study is to develop a multimodal neural network (MMNN) model that analyzes clinical variables and MRI images of a soft tissue sarcoma (STS) patient, to predict overall survival and risk of distant metastases. We compare the performance of this MMNN to models based on clinical variables alone, radiomics models, and an unimodal neural network. We include patients aged 18 or older with biopsy-proven STS who underwent primary resection between January 1st, 2005, and December 31st, 2020 with complete outcome data and a pre-treatment MRI with both a T1 post-contrast sequence and a T2 fat-sat sequence available. A total of 9380 MRI slices containing sarcomas from 287 patients are available. Our MMNN accepts the entire 3D sarcoma volume from T1 and T2 MRIs and clinical variables. Gradient blending allows the clinical and image sub-networks to optimally converge without overfitting. Heat maps were generated to visualize the salient image features. Our MMNN outperformed all other models in predicting overall survival and the risk of distant metastases. The C-Index of our MMNN for overall survival is 0.77 and the C-Index for risk of distant metastases is 0.70. The provided heat maps demonstrate areas of sarcomas deemed most salient for predictions. Our multimodal neural network with gradient blending improves predictions of overall survival and risk of distant metastases in patients with soft tissue sarcoma. Future work enabling accurate subtype-specific predictions will likely utilize similar end-to-end multimodal neural network architecture and require prospective curation of high-quality data, the inclusion of genomic data, and the involvement of multiple centers through federated learning."
Admission blood tests predicting survival of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients: a practical implementation of graph convolution network in imbalance dataset,other,"neural network, machine learning model, convolutional neural network","BACKGROUND: Predicting an individual's risk of death from COVID-19 is essential for planning and optimising resources. However, since the real-world mortality rate is relatively low, particularly in places like Hong Kong, this makes building an accurate prediction model difficult due to the imbalanced nature of the dataset. This study introduces an innovative application of graph convolutional networks (GCNs) to predict COVID-19 patient survival using a highly imbalanced dataset. Unlike traditional models, GCNs leverage structural relationships within the data, enhancing predictive accuracy and robustness. By integrating demographic and laboratory data into a GCN framework, our approach addresses class imbalance and demonstrates significant improvements in prediction accuracy.
METHODS: The cohort included all consecutive positive COVID-19 patients fulfilling study criteria admitted to 42 public hospitals in Hong Kong between January 23 and December 31, 2020 (n = 7,606). We proposed the population-based graph convolutional neural network (GCN) model which took blood test results, age and sex as inputs to predict the survival outcomes. Furthermore, we compared our proposed model to the Cox Proportional Hazard (CPH) model, conventional machine learning models, and oversampling machine learning models. Additionally, a subgroup analysis was performed on the test set in order to acquire a deeper understanding of the relationship between each patient node and its neighbours, revealing possible underlying causes of the inaccurate predictions.
RESULTS: The GCN model was the top-performing model, with an AUC of 0.944, considerably outperforming all other models (p < 0.05), including the oversampled CPH model (0.708), linear regression (0.877), Linear Discriminant Analysis (0.860), K-nearest neighbours (0.834), Gaussian predictor (0.745) and support vector machine (0.847). With Kaplan-Meier estimates, the GCN model demonstrated good discriminability between low- and high-risk individuals (p < 0.0001). Based on subanalysis using the weighted-in score, although the GCN model was able to discriminate well between different predicted groups, the separation was inadequate between false negative (FN) and true negative (TN) groups.
CONCLUSION: The GCN model considerably outperformed all other machine learning methods and baseline CPH models. Thus, when applied to this imbalanced COVID survival dataset, adopting a population graph representation may be an approach to achieving good prediction."
Prediction models for retinopathy of prematurity occurrence based on artificial neural network,other,"neural network, artificial neural network","INTRODUCTION: Early prediction and timely treatment are essential for minimizing the risk of visual loss or blindness of retinopathy of prematurity, emphasizing the importance of ROP screening in clinical routine.
OBJECTIVE: To establish predictive models for ROP occurrence based on the risk factors using artificial neural network.
METHODS: A cohort of 591 infants was recruited in this retrospective study. The association between ROP and perinatal factors was analyzed by univariate analysis and multivariable logistic regression. We developed predictive models for ROP screening using back propagation neural network, which was further optimized by applying genetic algorithm method. To assess the predictive performance of the models, the areas under the curve, sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value, positive predictive value and accuracy were used to show the performances of the prediction models.
RESULTS: ROP of any stage was found in 193 (32.7%) infants. Twelve risk factors of ROP were selected. Based on these factors, predictive models were built using BP neural network and genetic algorithm-back propagation (GA-BP) neural network. The areas under the curve for prediction models were 0.857, and 0.908 in test, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: We developed predictive models for ROP using artificial neural network. GA-BP neural network exhibited superior predictive ability for ROP when dealing with its non-linear clinical data."
Predicting lower limb lymphedema after cervical cancer surgery using artificial neural network and decision tree models,other,"neural network, artificial neural network","PURPOSE: This study aimed to develop and validate accessible artificial neural network and decision tree models to predict the risk of lower limb lymphedema after cervical cancer surgery.
METHODS: We selected 759 patients who underwent cervical cancer surgery at the Hunan Cancer Hospital from January 2010 to January 2020, collecting demographic, behavioral, clinicopathological, and disease-related data. The artificial neural network and decision tree techniques were used to construct prediction models for lower limb lymphedema after cervical cancer surgery. Then, the models' predictive efficacies were evaluated to select the optimal model using several methods, such as the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve and accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity tests.
RESULTS: In the training set, the artificial neural network and decision tree model accuracies for predicting lower limb lymphedema after cervical cancer surgery were 99.80% and 88.14%, and the sensitivities 99.50% and 74.01%, respectively; the specificities were 100% and 95.20%, respectively. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 1.00 for the artificial neural network and 0.92 for the decision tree model. In the test set, the artificial neural network and decision tree models' accuracies were 86.70% and 82.02%, and the sensitivities 65.70% and 67.11%, respectively; the specificities were 96.00% and 89.47%, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Both models had good predictive efficacy for lower limb lymphedema after cervical cancer surgery. However, the predictive performance and stability were superior in the artificial neural network model than in the decision tree model."
Predicting Clostridioides difficile infection outcomes with explainable machine learning,other,neural network,"BACKGROUND: Clostridioides difficile infection results in life-threatening short-term outcomes and the potential for subsequent recurrent infection. Predicting these outcomes at diagnosis, when important clinical decisions need to be made, has proven to be a difficult task.
METHODS: 52 clinical features from existing models or the literature were collected retrospectively within ±48 h of diagnosis among 1660 inpatient infections. A modified desirability of outcome ranking (DOOR) was designed to encompass clinically-important severe events attributable to the acute infection (intensive care transfer due to sepsis, shock, colectomy/ileostomy, mortality) and/or 60-day recurrence. A deep neural network was constructed and interpreted using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP). High-importance features were used to train a reduced, shallow network and performance was compared to existing conventional models (7 severity, 7 recurrence; after summing DOOR probabilities to align with conventional binary outputs) using area under the ROC curve (AUROC) and DeLong tests.
FINDINGS: The full (52-feature) model achieved an out-of-sample AUROC 0.823 for severity and 0.678 for recurrence. SHAP identified 13 unique, highly-important features (age, hypotension, initial treatment, onset, PCR cycle threshold, number of prior episodes, antibiotic exposure, fever, hypotension, pressors, leukocytosis, creatinine, lactate) that were used to train a reduced model, which performed similarly to the full model (severity AUROC difference P = 0.130; recurrence P = 0.426) and significantly better than the top severity model (reduced model predicting severity 0.837, ATLAS 0.749; P = 0.001). The reduced model also outperformed the top recurrence model, but this was not statistically-significant (reduced model recurrence AUROC 0.653, IDSA Recurrence Risk Criteria 0.595; P = 0.196). The final, reduced model was deployed as a web application with real-time SHAP explanations.
INTERPRETATION: Our final model outperformed existing severity and recurrence models; however, it requires external validation. A DOOR output allows specific clinical questions to be asked with explainable predictions that can be feasibly implemented with limited computing resources.

Comparison of model feature importance statistics to identify covariates that contribute most to model accuracy in prediction of insomnia,other,machine learning model,"IMPORTANCE: Sleep is critical to a person's physical and mental health and there is a need to create high performing machine learning models and critically understand how models rank covariates.
OBJECTIVE: The study aimed to compare how different model metrics rank the importance of various covariates.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A cross-sectional cohort study was conducted retrospectively using the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), which is publicly available.
METHODS: This study employed univariate logistic models to filter out strong, independent covariates associated with sleep disorder outcome, which were then used in machine-learning models, of which, the most optimal was chosen. The machine-learning model was used to rank model covariates based on gain, cover, and frequency to identify risk factors for sleep disorder and feature importance was evaluated using both univariable and multivariable t-statistics. A correlation matrix was created to determine the similarity of the importance of variables ranked by different model metrics.
RESULTS: The XGBoost model had the highest mean AUROC of 0.865 (SD = 0.010) with Accuracy of 0.762 (SD = 0.019), F1 of 0.875 (SD = 0.766), Sensitivity of 0.768 (SD = 0.023), Specificity of 0.782 (SD = 0.025), Positive Predictive Value of 0.806 (SD = 0.025), and Negative Predictive Value of 0.737 (SD = 0.034). The model metrics from the machine learning of gain and cover were strongly positively correlated with one another (r > 0.70). Model metrics from the multivariable model and univariable model were weakly negatively correlated with machine learning model metrics (R between -0.3 and 0).
CONCLUSION: The ranking of important variables associated with sleep disorder in this cohort from the machine learning models were not related to those from regression models."
Establishment and validation of an artificial intelligence web application for predicting postoperative in-hospital mortality in patients with hip fracture: a national cohort study of 52 707 cases,other,neural network,"BACKGROUND: In-hospital mortality following hip fractures is a significant concern, and accurate prediction of this outcome is crucial for appropriate clinical management. Nonetheless, there is a lack of effective prediction tools in clinical practice. By utilizing artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning techniques, this study aims to develop a predictive model that can assist clinicians in identifying geriatric hip fracture patients at a higher risk of in-hospital mortality.
METHODS: A total of 52 707 geriatric hip fracture patients treated with surgery from 90 hospitals were included in this study. The primary outcome was postoperative in-hospital mortality. The patients were randomly divided into two groups, with a ratio of 7:3. The majority of patients, assigned to the training cohort, were used to develop the AI models. The remaining patients, assigned to the validation cohort, were used to validate the models. Various machine learning algorithms, including logistic regression (LR), decision tree (DT), naïve bayesian (NB), neural network (NN), eXGBoosting machine (eXGBM), and random forest (RF), were employed for model development. A comprehensive scoring system, incorporating 10 evaluation metrics, was developed to assess the prediction performance, with higher scores indicating superior predictive capability. Based on the best machine learning-based model, an AI application was developed on the Internet. In addition, a comparative testing of prediction performance between doctors and the AI application.
FINDINGS: The eXGBM model exhibited the best prediction performance, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.908 (95% CI: 0.881-0.932), as well as the highest accuracy (0.820), precision (0.817), specificity (0.814), and F1 score (0.822), and the lowest Brier score (0.120) and log loss (0.374). Additionally, the model showed favorable calibration, with a slope of 0.999 and an intercept of 0.028. According to the scoring system incorporating 10 evaluation metrics, the eXGBM model achieved the highest score (56), followed by the RF model (48) and NN model (41). The LR, DT, and NB models had total scores of 27, 30, and 13, respectively. The AI application has been deployed online at https://in-hospitaldeathinhipfracture-l9vhqo3l55fy8dkdvuskvu.streamlit.app/ , based on the eXGBM model. The comparative testing revealed that the AI application's predictive capabilities significantly outperformed those of the doctors in terms of AUC values (0.908 vs. 0.682, P <0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: The eXGBM model demonstrates promising predictive performance in assessing the risk of postoperative in-hospital mortality among geriatric hip fracture patients. The developed AI model serves as a valuable tool to enhance clinical decision-making."
Establishment and Verification of an Artificial Intelligence Prediction Model for Children With Sepsis,other,"neural network, artificial neural network","BACKGROUND: Early identification of high-risk groups of children with sepsis is beneficial to reduce sepsis mortality. This article used artificial intelligence (AI) technology to predict the risk of death effectively and quickly in children with sepsis in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU).
STUDY DESIGN: This retrospective observational study was conducted in the PICUs of the First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University from December 2016 to June 2019 and Shenzhen Children's Hospital from January 2019 to July 2020. The children were divided into a death group and a survival group. Different machine language (ML) models were used to predict the risk of death in children with sepsis.
RESULTS: A total of 671 children with sepsis were enrolled. The accuracy (ACC) of the artificial neural network model was better than that of support vector machine, logical regression analysis, Bayesian, K nearest neighbor method and decision tree models, with a training set ACC of 0.99 and a test set ACC of 0.96.
CONCLUSIONS: The AI model can be used to predict the risk of death due to sepsis in children in the PICU, and the artificial neural network model is better than other AI models in predicting mortality risk."
Design of a novel intelligent computing framework for predictive solutions of malaria propagation model,other,"neural network, recurrent neural network","The paper presents an innovative computational framework for predictive solutions for simulating the spread of malaria. The structure incorporates sophisticated computing methods to improve the reliability of predicting malaria outbreaks. The study strives to provide a strong and effective tool for forecasting the propagation of malaria via the use of an AI-based recurrent neural network (RNN). The model is classified into two groups, consisting of humans and mosquitoes. To develop the model, the traditional Ross-Macdonald model is expanded upon, allowing for a more comprehensive analysis of the intricate dynamics at play. To gain a deeper understanding of the extended Ross model, we employ RNN, treating it as an initial value problem involving a system of first-order ordinary differential equations, each representing one of the seven profiles. This method enables us to obtain valuable insights and elucidate the complexities inherent in the propagation of malaria. Mosquitoes and humans constitute the two cohorts encompassed within the exposition of the mathematical dynamical model. Human dynamics are comprised of individuals who are susceptible, exposed, infectious, and in recovery. The mosquito population, on the other hand, is divided into three categories: susceptible, exposed, and infected. For RNN, we used the input of 0 to 300 days with an interval length of 3 days. The evaluation of the precision and accuracy of the methodology is conducted by superimposing the estimated solution onto the numerical solution. In addition, the outcomes obtained from the RNN are examined, including regression analysis, assessment of error autocorrelation, examination of time series response plots, mean square error, error histogram, and absolute error. A reduced mean square error signifies that the model's estimates are more accurate. The result is consistent with acquiring an approximate absolute error close to zero, revealing the efficacy of the suggested strategy. This research presents a novel approach to solving the malaria propagation model using recurrent neural networks. Additionally, it examines the behavior of various profiles under varying initial conditions of the malaria propagation model, which consists of a system of ordinary differential equations."
Prediction of hospital mortality among critically ill patients in a single centre in Asia: comparison of artificial neural networks and logistic regression-based model,other,"neural network, artificial neural network","INTRODUCTION: This study compared the performance of the artificial neural network (ANN) model with the Acute Physiologic and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II and IV models for predicting hospital mortality among critically ill patients in Hong Kong.
METHODS: This retrospective analysis included all patients admitted to the intensive care unit of Pamela Youde Nethersole Eastern Hospital from January 2010 to December 2019. The ANN model was constructed using parameters identical to the APACHE IV model. Discrimination performance was assessed using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC); calibration performance was evaluated using the Brier score and Hosmer-Lemeshow statistic.
RESULTS: In total, 14 503 patients were included, with 10% in the validation set and 90% in the ANN model development set. The ANN model (AUROC=0.88, 95% confidence interval [CI]=0.86-0.90, Brier score=0.10; P in Hosmer-Lemeshow test=0.37) outperformed the APACHE II model (AUROC=0.85, 95% CI=0.80-0.85, Brier score=0.14; P<0.001 for both comparisons of AUROCs and Brier scores) but showed performance similar to the APACHE IV model (AUROC=0.87, 95% CI=0.85-0.89, Brier score=0.11; P=0.34 for comparison of AUROCs, and P=0.05 for comparison of Brier scores). The ANN model demonstrated better calibration than the APACHE II and APACHE IV models.
CONCLUSION: Our ANN model outperformed the APACHE II model but was similar to the APACHE IV model in terms of predicting hospital mortality in Hong Kong. Artificial neural networks are valuable tools that can enhance real-time prognostic prediction."

Comparison of simulation and predictive efficacy for hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome incidence in mainland China based on five time series models,other,"neural network, convolutional neural network","BACKGROUND: Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) is a zoonotic infectious disease commonly found in Asia and Europe, characterized by fever, hemorrhage, shock, and renal failure. China is the most severely affected region, necessitating an analysis of the temporal incidence patterns in the country.
METHODS: We employed Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Nonlinear AutoRegressive with eXogenous inputs (NARX), and a hybrid CNN-LSTM model to model and forecast time series data spanning from January 2009 to November 2023 in the mainland China. By comparing the simulated performance of these models on training and testing sets, we determined the most suitable model.
RESULTS: Overall, the CNN-LSTM model demonstrated optimal fitting performance (with Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 93.77/270.66, 7.59%/38.96%, and 64.37/189.73 for the training and testing sets, respectively, lower than those of individual CNN or LSTM models).
CONCLUSION: The hybrid CNN-LSTM model seamlessly integrates CNN's data feature extraction and LSTM's recurrent prediction capabilities, rendering it theoretically applicable for simulating diverse distributed time series data. We recommend that the CNN-LSTM model be considered as a valuable time series analysis tool for disease prediction by policy-makers."
Trend analysis and prediction of gonorrhea in mainland China based on a hybrid time series model,other,None,"BACKGROUND: Gonorrhea has long been a serious public health problem in mainland China that requires attention, modeling to describe and predict its prevalence patterns can help the government to develop more scientific interventions.
METHODS: Time series (TS) data of the gonorrhea incidence in China from January 2004 to August 2022 were collected, with the incidence data from September 2021 to August 2022 as the validation. The seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) model, long short-term memory network (LSTM) model, and hybrid SARIMA-LSTM model were used to simulate the data respectively, the model performance were evaluated by calculating the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), root mean square error (RMSE), and mean absolute error (MAE) of the training and validation sets of the models.
RESULTS: The Seasonal components after data decomposition showed an approximate bimodal distribution with a period of 12 months. The three models identified were SARIMA(1,1,1) (2,1,2)<sub>12</sub>, LSTM with 150 hidden units, and SARIMA-LSTM with 150 hidden units, the SARIMA-LSTM model fitted best in the training and validation sets, for the smallest MAPE, RMSE, and MPE.
CONCLUSIONS: The overall incidence trend of gonorrhea in mainland China has been on the decline since 2004, with some periods exhibiting an upward trend. The incidence of gonorrhea displays a seasonal distribution, typically peaking in July and December each year. The SARIMA model, LSTM model, and SARIMA-LSTM model can all fit the monthly incidence time series data of gonorrhea in mainland China. However, in terms of predictive performance, the SARIMA-LSTM model outperforms the SARIMA and LSTM models, with the LSTM model surpassing the SARIMA model. This suggests that the SARIMA-LSTM model can serve as a preferred tool for time series analysis, providing evidence for the government to predict trends in gonorrhea incidence. The model's predictions indicate that the incidence of gonorrhea in mainland China will remain at a high level in 2024, necessitating that policymakers implement public health measures in advance to prevent the spread of the disease."
Artificial intelligence enhanced ophthalmological screening in children: insights from a cohort study in Lubelskie Voivodeship,other,"neural network, convolutional neural network","This study aims to investigate the prevalence of visual impairments, such as myopia, hyperopia, and astigmatism, among school-age children (7-9 years) in Lubelskie Voivodeship (Republic of Poland) and apply artificial intelligence (AI) in the detection of severe ocular diseases. A total of 1049 participants (1.7% of the total child population in the region) were examined through a combination of standardized visual acuity tests, autorefraction, and assessment of fundus images by a convolutional neural network (CNN) model. The results from this artificial intelligence (AI) model were juxtaposed with assessments conducted by two experienced ophthalmologists to gauge the model's accuracy. The results demonstrated myopia, hyperopia, and astigmatism prevalences of 3.7%, 16.9%, and 7.8%, respectively, with myopia showing a significant age-related increase and hyperopia decreasing with age. The AI model performance was evaluated using the Dice coefficient, reaching 93.3%, indicating that the CNN model was highly accurate. The study underscores the utility of AI in the early detection and diagnosis of severe ocular diseases, providing a foundation for future research to improve paediatric ophthalmic screening and treatment outcomes."
A hybrid model for hand-foot-mouth disease prediction based on ARIMA-EEMD-LSTM,other,None,"BACKGROUND: Hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) is a common infectious disease that poses a serious threat to children all over the world. However, the current prediction models for HFMD still require improvement in accuracy. In this study, we proposed a hybrid model based on autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) and long short-term memory (LSTM) to predict the trend of HFMD.
METHODS: The data used in this study was sourced from the National Clinical Research Center for Child Health and Disorders, Chongqing, China. The daily reported incidence of HFMD from 1 January 2015 to 27 July 2023 was collected to develop an ARIMA-EEMD-LSTM hybrid model. ARIMA, LSTM, ARIMA-LSTM and EEMD-LSTM models were developed to compare with the proposed hybrid model. Root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE) and coefficient of determination (R2) were adopted to evaluate the performances of the prediction models.
RESULTS: Overall, ARIMA-EEMD-LSTM model achieved the most accurate prediction for HFMD, with RMSE, MAPE and R2 of 4.37, 2.94 and 0.996, respectively. Performing EEMD on the residual sequence yields 11 intrinsic mode functions. EEMD-LSTM model is the second best, with RMSE, MAPE and R2 of 6.20, 3.98 and 0.996.
CONCLUSION: Results showed the advantage of ARIMA-EEMD-LSTM model over the ARIMA model, the LSTM model, the ARIMA-LSTM model and the EEMD-LSTM model. For the prevention and control of epidemics, the proposed hybrid model may provide a more powerful help. Compared with other three models, the two integrated with EEMD method showed significant improvement in predictive capability, offering novel insights for modeling of disease time series."
A data-driven epidemic model with human mobility and vaccination protection for COVID-19 prediction,other,neural network,"Epidemiological models allow for quantifying the dynamic characteristics of large-scale outbreaks. However, capturing detailed and accurate epidemiological information often requires consideration of multiple kinetic mechanisms and parameters. Due to the uncertainty of pandemic evolution, such as pathogen variation, host immune response and changes in mitigation strategies, the parameter evaluation and state prediction of complex epidemiological models are challenging. Here, we develop a data-driven epidemic model with a generalized SEIR mechanistic structure that includes new compartments, human mobility and vaccination protection. To address the issue of model complexity, we embed the epidemiological model dynamics into physics-informed neural networks (PINN), taking the observed series of time instances as direct input of the network to simultaneously infer unknown parameters and unobserved dynamics of the underlying model. Using actual data during the COVID-19 outbreak in Australia, Israel, and Switzerland, our model framework demonstrates satisfactory performance in multi-step ahead predictions compared to several benchmark models. Moreover, our model infers time-varying parameters such as transmission rates, hospitalization ratios, and effective reproduction numbers, as well as calculates the latent period and asymptomatic infection count, which are typically unreported in public data. Finally, we employ the proposed data-driven model to analyze the impact of different mitigation strategies on COVID-19."
Algorithmic Fairness of Machine Learning Models for Alzheimer Disease Progression,other,"neural network, machine learning model, recurrent neural network","IMPORTANCE: Predictive models using machine learning techniques have potential to improve early detection and management of Alzheimer disease (AD). However, these models potentially have biases and may perpetuate or exacerbate existing disparities.
OBJECTIVE: To characterize the algorithmic fairness of longitudinal prediction models for AD progression.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This prognostic study investigated the algorithmic fairness of logistic regression, support vector machines, and recurrent neural networks for predicting progression to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD using data from participants in the Alzheimer Disease Neuroimaging Initiative evaluated at 57 sites in the US and Canada. Participants aged 54 to 91 years who contributed data on at least 2 visits between September 2005 and May 2017 were included. Data were analyzed in October 2022.
EXPOSURES: Fairness was quantified across sex, ethnicity, and race groups. Neuropsychological test scores, anatomical features from T1 magnetic resonance imaging, measures extracted from positron emission tomography, and cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers were included as predictors.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Outcome measures quantified fairness of prediction models (logistic regression [LR], support vector machine [SVM], and recurrent neural network [RNN] models), including equal opportunity, equalized odds, and demographic parity. Specifically, if the model exhibited equal sensitivity for all groups, it aligned with the principle of equal opportunity, indicating fairness in predictive performance.
RESULTS: A total of 1730 participants in the cohort (mean [SD] age, 73.81 [6.92] years; 776 females [44.9%]; 69 Hispanic [4.0%] and 1661 non-Hispanic [96.0%]; 29 Asian [1.7%], 77 Black [4.5%], 1599 White [92.4%], and 25 other race [1.4%]) were included. Sensitivity for predicting progression to MCI and AD was lower for Hispanic participants compared with non-Hispanic participants; the difference (SD) in true positive rate ranged from 20.9% (5.5%) for the RNN model to 27.8% (9.8%) for the SVM model in MCI and 24.1% (5.4%) for the RNN model to 48.2% (17.3%) for the LR model in AD. Sensitivity was similarly lower for Black and Asian participants compared with non-Hispanic White participants; for example, the difference (SD) in AD true positive rate was 14.5% (51.6%) in the LR model, 12.3% (35.1%) in the SVM model, and 28.4% (16.8%) in the RNN model for Black vs White participants, and the difference (SD) in MCI true positive rate was 25.6% (13.1%) in the LR model, 24.3% (13.1%) in the SVM model, and 6.8% (18.7%) in the RNN model for Asian vs White participants. Models generally satisfied metrics of fairness with respect to sex, with no significant differences by group, except for cognitively normal (CN)-MCI and MCI-AD transitions (eg, an absolute increase [SD] in the true positive rate of CN-MCI transitions of 10.3% [27.8%] for the LR model).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this study, models were accurate in aggregate but failed to satisfy fairness metrics. These findings suggest that fairness should be considered in the development and use of machine learning models for AD progression."
A hybrid model for tuberculosis forecasting based on empirical mode decomposition in China,other,None,"BACKGROUND: Pulmonary Tuberculosis is a major public health problem endangering people's health, a scientifically accurate predictive model is of great practical significance for the prevention and treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis.
METHODS: The reported incidence data of pulmonary tuberculosis were from the National Public Health Science Data Center ( https://www.phsciencedata.cn/ ). The ARIMA, LSTM, EMD-SARIMA, EMD-LSTM, EMD-ARMA-LSTM models were established using the reported monthly incidence of tuberculosis reported in China from January 2008 to December 2018.

Application of optimized LSTM in prediction of the cumulative confirmed cases of COVID-19,other,None,"This paper proposes an optimized Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM+) model for predicting cumulative confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Germany, the UK, Italy, and Japan. The LSTM+ model incorporates two key optimizations: (1) fine-adjustment of parameters and (2) a 're-prediction' process that utilizes the latest prediction results from the previous iteration. The performance of the LSTM+ model is evaluated and compared with that of Backpropagation (BP) and traditional LSTM models. The results demonstrate that the LSTM+ model significantly outperforms both BP and LSTM models, achieving a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of less than 0.6%. Additionally, two illustrative examples employing the LSTM+ model further validate its general applicability and practical performance for predicting cumulative confirmed COVID-19 cases."
Survival prediction and prognostic factors in colorectal cancer after curative surgery: insights from cox regression and neural networks,other,neural network,"Medical research frequently relies on Cox regression to analyze the survival distribution of cancer patients. Nonetheless, in specific scenarios, neural networks hold the potential to serve as a robust alternative. In this study, we aim to scrutinize the effectiveness of Cox regression and neural network models in assessing the survival outcomes of patients who have undergone treatment for colorectal cancer. We conducted a retrospective study on 284 colorectal cancer patients who underwent surgery at Imam Khomeini clinic in Hamadan between 2001 and 2017. The data was used to train both Cox regression and neural network models, and their predictive accuracy was compared using diagnostic measures such as sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, accuracy, negative predictive value, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. The analyses were performed using STATA 17 and R4.0.4 software. The study revealed that the best neural network model had a sensitivity of 74.5% (95% CI 61.0-85.0), specificity of 83.3% (65.3-94.4), positive predictive value of 89.1% (76.4-96.4), negative predictive value of 64.1% (47.2-78.8), AUC of 0.79 (0.70-0.88), and accuracy of 0.776 for death prediction. For recurrence, the best neural network model had a sensitivity of 88.1% (74.4-96.0%), specificity of 83.7% (69.3-93.2%), positive predictive value of 84.1% (69.9-93.4%), negative predictive value of 87.8% (73.8-95.9%), AUC of 0.86 (0.78-0.93), and accuracy of 0.859. The Cox model had comparable results, with a sensitivity of 73.6% (64.8-81.2) and 85.5% (78.3-91.0), specificity of 89.6% (83.8-93.8) and 98.0% (94.4-99.6), positive predictive value of 84.0% (75.6-90.4) and 97.4% (92.6-99.5), negative predictive value of 82.0% (75.6-90.4) and 88.8% (0.83-93.1), AUC of 0.82 (0.77-0.86) and 0.92 (0.89-0.95), and accuracy of 0.88 and 0.92 for death and recurrence prediction, respectively. In conclusion, the study found that both Cox regression and neural network models are effective in predicting early recurrence and death in patients with colorectal cancer after curative surgery. The neural network model showed slightly better sensitivity and negative predictive value for death, while the Cox model had better specificity and positive predictive value for recurrence. Overall, both models demonstrated high accuracy and AUC, indicating their usefulness in predicting these outcomes."
LSTM-based recurrent neural network provides effective short term flu forecasting,other,neural network,"BACKGROUND: Influenza virus is responsible for a yearly epidemic in much of the world. To better predict short-term, seasonal variations in flu infection rates and possible mechanisms of yearly infection variation, we trained a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)-based deep neural network on historical Influenza-Like-Illness (ILI), climate, and population data.
METHODS: Data were collected from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the National Center for Environmental Information (NCEI), and the United States Census Bureau. The model was initially built in Python using the Keras API and tuned manually. We explored the roles of temperature, precipitation, local wind speed, population size, vaccination rate, and vaccination efficacy. The model was validated using K-fold cross validation as well as forward chaining cross validation and compared to several standard algorithms. Finally, simulation data was generated in R and used for further exploration of the model.
RESULTS: We found that temperature is the strongest predictor of ILI rates, but also found that precipitation increased the predictive power of the network. Additionally, the proposed model achieved a +1 week prediction mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.1973. This is less than half of the MAE achieved by the next best performing algorithm. Additionally, the model accurately predicted simulation data. To test the role of temperature in the network, we phase-shifted temperature in time and found a predictable reduction in prediction accuracy.
CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest that short term flu forecasting may be effectively accomplished using architectures traditionally reserved for time series analysis. The proposed LSTM-based model was able to outperform comparison models at the +1 week time point. Additionally, this model provided insight into the week-to-week effects of climatic and biotic factors and revealed potential patterns in data series. Specifically, we found that temperature is the strongest predictor of seasonal flu infection rates. This information may prove to be especially important for flu forecasting given the uncertain long-term impact of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic on seasonal influenza."

SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: This study was based on the monitoring data of chronic disease risk factors in Dongguan residents from 2016 to 2018. The multistage cluster random sampling method was adopted at each monitoring site, and 4157 people were finally selected. In the initial population, we excluded individuals with more than 20% missing data and eventually included 4106 subjects.
DESIGN: K nearest neighbour algorithm and synthetic minority oversampling technique were used to process the data. Single factor analysis was used for preliminary selection of variables. The 10-fold cross-validation was used to optimise the parameters of some models. The accuracy, precision, recall and area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) were used to evaluate the prediction effect of models, and Delong test was used to analyse the differences of AUC values of each model.
RESULTS: After balancing data, the sample size increased to 8013, of which 4023 are patients with T2DM and 3990 in control group. The comparison results of the six models showed that back propagation neural network model has the best prediction effect with 93.7% accuracy, 94.6% accuracy, 92.8% recall and the AUC value of 0.977, followed by logistic model, support vector machine model, CART decision tree model and C4.5 decision tree model. Deep neural network has the worst prediction performance, with 84.5% accuracy, 86.1% precision, 82.9% recall and the AUC value of 0.845.
CONCLUSIONS: In this study, six types of risk prediction models for T2DM were constructed, and the predictive effects of these models were compared based on various indicators. The results showed that back propagation neural network based on the selected data set had the best prediction effect."
Machine Learning Predicts Patients With New-onset Diabetes at Risk of Pancreatic Cancer,other,machine learning model,"BACKGROUND: New-onset diabetes represent a high-risk cohort to screen for pancreatic cancer.
GOALS: Develop a machine model to predict pancreatic cancer among patients with new-onset diabetes.
STUDY: A retrospective cohort of patients with new-onset diabetes was assembled from multiple health care networks in the United States. An XGBoost machine learning model was designed from a portion of this cohort (the training set) and tested on the remaining part of the cohort (the test set). Shapley values were used to explain the XGBoost's model features. Model performance was compared with 2 contemporary models designed to predict pancreatic cancer among patients with new-onset diabetes.
RESULTS: In the test set, the XGBoost model had an area under the curve of 0.80 (0.76 to 0.85) compared with 0.63 and 0.68 for other models. Using cutoffs based on the Youden index, the sensitivity of the XGBoost model was 75%, the specificity was 70%, the accuracy was 70%, the positive predictive value was 1.2%, and the negative predictive value was >99%. The XGBoost model obtained a positive predictive value of at least 2.5% with a sensitivity of 38%. The XGBoost model was the only model that detected at least 50% of patients with cancer one year after the onset of diabetes. All 3 models had similar features that predicted pancreatic cancer, including older age, weight loss, and the rapid destabilization of glucose homeostasis.
CONCLUSION: Machine learning models isolate a high-risk cohort from those with new-onset diabetes at risk for pancreatic cancer."
Prediction of dengue cases using the attention-based long short-term memory (LSTM) approach,other,neural network,"This research proposes a 'temporal attention' addition for long-short term memory (LSTM) models for dengue prediction. The number of monthly dengue cases was collected for each of five Malaysian states i.e. Selangor, Kelantan, Johor, Pulau Pinang, and Melaka from 2011 to 2016. Climatic, demographic, geographic and temporal attributes were used as covariates. The proposed LSTM models with temporal attention was compared with several benchmark models including a linear support vector machine (LSVM), a radial basis function support vector machine (RBFSVM), a decision tree (DT), a shallow neural network (SANN) and a deep neural network (D-ANN). In addition, experiments were conducted to analyze the impact of look-back settings on each model performance. The results showed that the attention LSTM (A-LSTM) model performed best, with the stacked, attention LSTM (SA-LSTM) one in second place. The LSTM and stacked LSTM (S-LSTM) models performed almost identically but with the accuracy improved by the attention mechanism was added. Indeed, they were both found to be superior to the benchmark models mentioned above. The best results were obtained when all attributes were included in the model. The four models (LSTM, S-LSTM, A-LSTM and SA-LSTM) were able to accurately predict dengue presence 1-6 months ahead. Our findings provide a more accurate dengue prediction model than previously used, with the prospect of also applying this approach in other geographic areas."
An interpretable hybrid predictive model of COVID-19 cases using autoregressive model and LSTM,other,neural network,"The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has had a profound impact on global health and economy, making it crucial to build accurate and interpretable data-driven predictive models for COVID-19 cases to improve public policy making. The extremely large scale of the pandemic and the intrinsically changing transmission characteristics pose a great challenge for effectively predicting COVID-19 cases. To address this challenge, we propose a novel hybrid model in which the interpretability of the Autoregressive model (AR) and the predictive power of the long short-term memory neural networks (LSTM) join forces. The proposed hybrid model is formalized as a neural network with an architecture that connects two composing model blocks, of which the relative contribution is decided data-adaptively in the training procedure. We demonstrate the favorable performance of the hybrid model over its two single composing models as well as other popular predictive models through comprehensive numerical studies on two data sources under multiple evaluation metrics. Specifically, in county-level data of 8 California counties, our hybrid model achieves 4.173% MAPE, outperforming the composing AR (5.629%) and LSTM (4.934%) alone on average. In country-level datasets, our hybrid model outperforms the widely-used predictive models such as AR, LSTM, Support Vector Machines, Gradient Boosting, and Random Forest, in predicting the COVID-19 cases in Japan, Canada, Brazil, Argentina, Singapore, Italy, and the United Kingdom. In addition to the predictive performance, we illustrate the interpretability of our proposed hybrid model using the estimated AR component, which is a key feature that is not shared by most black-box predictive models for COVID-19 cases. Our study provides a new and promising direction for building effective and interpretable data-driven models for COVID-19 cases, which could have significant implications for public health policy making and control of the current COVID-19 and potential future pandemics."
Explainable prediction of daily hospitalizations for cerebrovascular disease using stacked ensemble learning,other,"neural network, artificial neural network","BACKGROUND: With the prevalence of cerebrovascular disease (CD) and the increasing strain on healthcare resources, forecasting the healthcare demands of cerebrovascular patients has significant implications for optimizing medical resources.
METHODS: In this study, a stacking ensemble model comprised of four base learners (ridge regression, random forest, gradient boosting decision tree, and artificial neural network) and a meta learner (elastic net) was proposed for predicting the daily number of hospital admissions (HAs) for CD using the historical HAs data, air quality data, and meteorological data in Chengdu, China from 2015 to 2018. To solve the label imbalance problem, a re-weighting method based on label distribution smoothing was integrated into the meta learner. We trained the model using the data from 2015 to 2017 and evaluated its predictive ability using the data in 2018 based on four metrics, including mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), and coefficient of determination (R2). In addition, the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) framework was applied to provide explanation for the prediction of our stacking model.
RESULTS: Our proposed model outperformed all the base learners and long short-term memory (LSTM) on two datasets. Particularly, compared with the optimal results obtained by individual models, the MAE, RMSE, and MAPE of the stacking model decreased by 13.9%, 12.7%, and 5.8%, respectively, and the R2 improved by 6.8% on CD dataset. The model explanation demonstrated that environmental features played a role in further improving the model performance and identified that high temperature and high concentrations of gaseous air pollutants might strongly associate with an increased risk of CD.
CONCLUSIONS: Our stacking model considering environmental exposure is efficient in predicting daily HAs for CD and has practical value in early warning and healthcare resource allocation."
Epidemic efficacy of Covid-19 vaccination against Omicron: An innovative approach using enhanced residual recurrent neural network,other,"neural network, recurrent neural network","The outbreak of COVID-19 has engulfed the entire world since the end of 2019, causing tremendous loss of lives. It has also taken a toll on the healthcare sector due to the inability to accurately predict the spread of disease as the arrangements for the essential supply of medical items largely depend on prior predictions. The objective of the study is to train a reliable model for predicting the spread of Coronavirus. The prediction capabilities of various powerful models such as the Autoregression Model (AR), Global Autoregression (GAR), Stacked-LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory), ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average), Facebook Prophet (FBProphet), and Residual Recurrent Neural Network (Res-RNN) were taken into consideration for predicting COVID-19 using the historical data of daily confirmed cases along with Twitter data. The COVID-19 prediction results attained from these models were not up to the mark. To enhance the prediction results, a novel model is proposed that utilizes the power of Res-RNN with some modifications. Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) and LSTM units are also introduced in the model to handle the long-term dependencies. Neural Networks being data-hungry, a merged layer was added before the linear layer to combine tweet volume as additional features to reach data augmentation. The residual links are used to handle the overfitting problem. The proposed model RNN Convolutional Residual Network (RNNCON-Res) showcases dominating capability in country-level prediction 20 days ahead with respect to existing State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) methods. Sufficient experimentation was performed to analyze the prediction capability of different models. It was found that the proposed model RNNCON-Res has achieved 91% accuracy, which is better than all other existing models."
Machine Learning Prediction Model of Tuberculosis Incidence Based on Meteorological Factors and Air Pollutants,other,neural network,"BACKGROUND: Tuberculosis (TB) is a public health problem worldwide, and the influence of meteorological and air pollutants on the incidence of tuberculosis have been attracting interest from researchers. It is of great importance to use machine learning to build a prediction model of tuberculosis incidence influenced by meteorological and air pollutants for timely and applicable measures of both prevention and control.
METHODS: The data of daily TB notifications, meteorological factors and air pollutants in Changde City, Hunan Province ranging from 2010 to 2021 were collected. Spearman rank correlation analysis was conducted to analyze the correlation between the daily TB notifications and the meteorological factors or air pollutants. Based on the correlation analysis results, machine learning methods, including support vector regression, random forest regression and a BP neural network model, were utilized to construct the incidence prediction model of tuberculosis. RMSE, MAE and MAPE were performed to evaluate the constructed model for selecting the best prediction model.
RESULTS: (1) From the year 2010 to 2021, the overall incidence of tuberculosis in Changde City showed a downward trend. (2) The daily TB notifications was positively correlated with average temperature (r = 0.231), maximum temperature (r = 0.194), minimum temperature (r = 0.165), sunshine duration (r = 0.329), PM<sub>2.5</sub> (r = 0.097), PM<sub>10</sub> (r = 0.215) and O<sub>3</sub> (r = 0.084) (p &lt; 0.05). However, there was a significant negative correlation between the daily TB notifications and mean air pressure (r = -0.119), precipitation (r = -0.063), relative humidity (r = -0.084), CO (r = -0.038) and SO<sub>2</sub> (r = -0.034) (p &lt; 0.05). (3) The random forest regression model had the best fitting effect, while the BP neural network model exhibited the best prediction. (4) The validation set of the BP neural network model, including average daily temperature, sunshine hours and PM<sub>10</sub>, showed the lowest root mean square error, mean absolute error and mean absolute percentage error, followed by support vector regression.
CONCLUSIONS: The prediction trend of the BP neural network model, including average daily temperature, sunshine hours and PM<sub>10</sub>, successfully mimics the actual incidence, and the peak incidence highly coincides with the actual aggregation time, with a high accuracy and a minimum error. Taken together, these data suggest that the BP neural network model can predict the incidence trend of tuberculosis in Changde City."
Neural parameter calibration for large-scale multiagent models,other,neural network,"Computational models have become a powerful tool in the quantitative sciences to understand the behavior of complex systems that evolve in time. However, they often contain a potentially large number of free parameters whose values cannot be obtained from theory but need to be inferred from data. This is especially the case for models in the social sciences, economics, or computational epidemiology. Yet, many current parameter estimation methods are mathematically involved and computationally slow to run. In this paper, we present a computationally simple and fast method to retrieve accurate probability densities for model parameters using neural differential equations. We present a pipeline comprising multiagent models acting as forward solvers for systems of ordinary or stochastic differential equations and a neural network to then extract parameters from the data generated by the model. The two combined create a powerful tool that can quickly estimate densities on model parameters, even for very large systems. We demonstrate the method on synthetic time series data of the SIR model of the spread of infection and perform an in-depth analysis of the Harris-Wilson model of economic activity on a network, representing a nonconvex problem. For the latter, we apply our method both to synthetic data and to data of economic activity across Greater London. We find that our method calibrates the model orders of magnitude more accurately than a previous study of the same dataset using classical techniques, while running between 195 and 390 times faster."
"Correlations between COVID-19 and dengue obtained via the study of South America, Africa and Southeast Asia during the 2020s",other,neural network,"A dramatic increase in the number of outbreaks of dengue has recently been reported, and climate change is likely to extend the geographical spread of the disease. In this context, this paper shows how a neural network approach can incorporate dengue and COVID-19 data as well as external factors (such as social behaviour or climate variables), to develop predictive models that could improve our knowledge and provide useful tools for health policy makers. Through the use of neural networks with different social and natural parameters, in this paper we define a Correlation Model through which we show that the number of cases of COVID-19 and dengue have very similar trends. We then illustrate the relevance of our model by extending it to a Long short-term memory model (LSTM) that incorporates both diseases, and using this to estimate dengue infections via COVID-19 data in countries that lack sufficient dengue data."
Cardiovascular complications in a diabetes prediction model using machine learning: a systematic review,other,neural network,"Prediction model has been the focus of studies since the last century in the diagnosis and prognosis of various diseases. With the advancement in computational technology, machine learning (ML) has become the widely used tool to develop a prediction model. This review is to investigate the current development of prediction model for the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) among type 2 diabetes (T2DM) patients using machine learning. A systematic search on Scopus and Web of Science (WoS) was conducted to look for relevant articles based on the research question. The risk of bias (ROB) for all articles were assessed based on the Prediction model Risk of Bias Assessment Tool (PROBAST) statement. Neural network with 76.6% precision, 88.06% sensitivity, and area under the curve (AUC) of 0.91 was found to be the most reliable algorithm in developing prediction model for cardiovascular disease among type 2 diabetes patients. The overall concern of applicability of all included studies is low. While two out of 10 studies were shown to have high ROB, another studies ROB are unknown due to the lack of information. The adherence to reporting standards was conducted based on the Transparent Reporting of a multivariable prediction model for Individual Prognosis or Diagnosis (TRIPOD) standard where the overall score is 53.75%. It is highly recommended that future model development should adhere to the PROBAST and TRIPOD assessment to reduce the risk of bias and ensure its applicability in clinical settings. Potential lipid peroxidation marker is also recommended in future cardiovascular disease prediction model to improve overall model applicability."
Short-term prognosis for hepatocellular carcinoma patients with lung metastasis: A retrospective cohort study based on the SEER database,other,neural network,"Our study aimed to develop a prediction model to predict the short-term mortality of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients with lung metastasis. The retrospective data of HCC patients with lung metastasis was from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results registration database between 2010 and 2015. 1905 patients were randomly divided into training set (n = 1333) and validation set (n = 572). There were 1092 patients extracted from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database 2015 to 2019 as the validation set. The variable importance was calculated to screen predictors. The constructed prediction models of logistic regression, random forest, broad learning system, deep neural network, support vector machine, and naïve Bayes were compared through the predictive performance. The mortality of HCC patients with lung metastasis was 51.65% within 1 month. The screened prognostic factors (age, N stage, T stage, tumor size, surgery, grade, radiation, and chemotherapy) and gender were used to construct prediction models. The area under curve (0.853 vs. 0.771) of random forest model was more optimized than that of logistic regression model in the training set. But, there were no significant differences in testing and validation sets between random forest and logistic regression models. The value of area under curve in the logistic regression model was significantly higher than that of the broad learning system model (0.763 vs. 0.745), support vector machine model (0.763 vs. 0.689) in the validation set, and higher than that of the naïve Bayes model (0.775 vs. 0.744) in the testing model. We further chose the logistic regression prediction model and built the prognostic nomogram. We have developed a prediction model for predicting short-term mortality with 9 easily acquired predictors of HCC patients with lung metastasis, which performed well in the internal and external validation. It could assist clinicians to adjust treatment strategies in time to improve the prognosis."
Application of back propagation neural network model optimized by particle swarm algorithm in predicting the risk of hypertension,other,neural network,"The structure of a back propagation neural network was optimized by a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm, and a back propagation neural network model based on a PSO algorithm was constructed. By comparison with a general back propagation neural network and logistic regression, the fitting performance and prediction performance of the PSO algorithm is discussed. Furthermore, based on the back propagation neural network optimized by the PSO algorithm, the risk factors related to hypertension were further explored through the mean influence value algorithm to construct a risk prediction model. In the evaluation of the fitting effect, the root mean square error and coefficient of determination of the back propagation neural network based on the PSO algorithm were 0.09 and 0.29, respectively. In the comparison of prediction performance, the accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the back propagation neural network based on PSO algorithm were 85.38%, 43.90%, 96.66%, and 0.86, respectively. The results showed that the backpropagation neural network optimized by PSO had the best fitting effect and prediction performance. Meanwhile, the mean impact value algorithm could screen out the risk factors related to hypertension and build a disease prediction model, which can provide clues for exploring the pathogenesis of hypertension and preventing hypertension."
A Modified PINN Approach for Identifiable Compartmental Models in Epidemiology with Application to COVID-19,other,neural network,"Many approaches using compartmental models have been used to study the COVID-19 pandemic, with machine learning methods applied to these models having particularly notable success. We consider the Susceptible-Infected-Confirmed-Recovered-Deceased (SICRD) compartmental model, with the goal of estimating the unknown infected compartment I, and several unknown parameters. We apply a variation of a ""Physics Informed Neural Network"" (PINN), which uses knowledge of the system to aid learning. First, we ensure estimation is possible by verifying the model's identifiability. Then, we propose a wavelet transform to process data for the network training. Finally, our central result is a novel modification of the PINN's loss function to reduce the number of simultaneously considered unknowns. We find that our modified network is capable of stable, efficient, and accurate estimation, while the unmodified network consistently yields incorrect values. The modified network is also shown to be efficient enough to be applied to a model with time-varying parameters. We present an application of our model results for ranking states by their estimated relative testing efficiency. Our findings suggest the effectiveness of our modified PINN network, especially in the case of multiple unknown variables."
Modeling and Forecasting Monkeypox Cases Using Stochastic Models,other,multilayer perceptron,"BACKGROUND: Monkeypox virus is gaining attention due to its severity and spread among people. This study sheds light on the modeling and forecasting of new monkeypox cases. Knowledge about the future situation of the virus using a more accurate time series and stochastic models is required for future actions and plans to cope with the challenge.
METHODS: We conduct a side-by-side comparison of the machine learning approach with the traditional time series model. The multilayer perceptron model (MLP), a machine learning technique, and the Box-Jenkins methodology, also known as the ARIMA model, are used for classical modeling. Both methods are applied to the Monkeypox cumulative data set and compared using different model selection criteria such as root mean square error, mean square error, mean absolute error, and mean absolute percentage error.
RESULTS: With a root mean square error of 150.78, the monkeypox series follows the ARIMA (7,1,7) model among the other potential models. Comparatively, we use the multilayer perceptron (MLP) model, which employs the sigmoid activation function and has a different number of hidden neurons in a single hidden layer. The root mean square error of the MLP model, which uses a single input and ten hidden neurons, is 54.40, significantly lower than that of the ARIMA model. The actual confirmed cases versus estimated or fitted plots also demonstrate that the multilayer perceptron model has a better fit for the monkeypox data than the ARIMA model.
CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATION: When it comes to predicting monkeypox, the machine learning method outperforms the traditional time series. A better match can be achieved in future studies by applying the extreme learning machine model (ELM), support vector machine (SVM), and some other methods with various activation functions. It is thus concluded that the selected data provide a real picture of the virus. If the situations remain the same, governments and other stockholders should ensure the follow-up of Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) among the masses, as the trends will continue rising in the upcoming 10 days. However, governments should take some serious interventions to cope with the virus.
LIMITATION: In the ARIMA models selected for forecasting, we did not incorporate the effect of covariates such as the effect of net migration of monkeypox virus patients, government interventions, etc."
Prediction models and associated factors on the fertility behaviors of the floating population in China,other,"neural network, artificial neural network","The floating population has been growing rapidly in China, and their fertility behaviors do affect urban management and development. Based on the data set of the China Migrants Dynamic Survey in 2016, the logistic regression model and multiple linear regression model were used to explore the related factors of fertility behaviors among the floating populace. The artificial neural network model, the naive Bayes model, and the logistic regression model were used for prediction. The findings showed that age, gender, ethnic, household registration, education level, occupation, duration of residence, scope of migration, housing, economic conditions, and health services all affected the reproductive behavior of the floating population. Among them, the improvement duration of post-migration residence and family economic conditions positively impacted their fertility behavior. Non-agricultural new industry workers with college degrees or above living in first-tier cities were less likely to have children and more likely to delay childbearing. Among the prediction models, both the artificial neural network model and logistic regression model had better prediction effects. Improving the employment and income of new industry workers, and introducing preferential housing policies might improve their probability of bearing children. The artificial neural network and logistic regression model could predict individual fertility behavior and provide a scientific basis for the urban population management."
Machine Learning Algorithms for understanding the determinants of under-five Mortality,other,"neural network, machine learning model","BACKGROUND: Under-five mortality is a matter of serious concern for child health as well as the social development of any country. The paper aimed to find the accuracy of machine learning models in predicting under-five mortality and identify the most significant factors associated with under-five mortality.
METHOD: The data was taken from the National Family Health Survey (NFHS-IV) of Uttar Pradesh. First, we used multivariate logistic regression due to its capability for predicting the important factors, then we used machine learning techniques such as decision tree, random forest, Naïve Bayes, K- nearest neighbor (KNN), logistic regression, support vector machine (SVM), neural network, and ridge classifier. Each model's accuracy was checked by a confusion matrix, accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, Cohen's Kappa, and area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUROC). Information gain rank was used to find the important factors for under-five mortality. Data analysis was performed using, STATA-16.0, Python 3.3, and IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 27.0 software.
RESULT: By applying the machine learning models, results showed that the neural network model was the best predictive model for under-five mortality when compared with other predictive models, with model accuracy of (95.29% to 95.96%), recall (71.51% to 81.03%), precision (36.64% to 51.83%), F1 score (50.46% to 62.68%), Cohen's Kappa value (0.48 to 0.60), AUROC range (93.51% to 96.22%) and precision-recall curve range (99.52% to 99.73%). The neural network was the most efficient model, but logistic regression also shows well for predicting under-five mortality with accuracy (94% to 95%)., AUROC range (93.4% to 94.8%), and precision-recall curve (99.5% to 99.6%). The number of living children, survival time, wealth index, child size at birth, birth in the last five years, the total number of children ever born, mother's education level, and birth order were identified as important factors influencing under-five mortality.
CONCLUSION: The neural network model was a better predictive model compared to other machine learning models in predicting under-five mortality, but logistic regression analysis also shows good results. These models may be helpful for the analysis of high-dimensional data for health research."
Machine Learning Models for Prediction of Posttreatment Recurrence in Early-Stage Hepatocellular Carcinoma Using Pretreatment Clinical and MRI Features: A Proof-of-Concept Study,other,"neural network, convolutional neural network","BACKGROUND. Posttreatment recurrence is an unpredictable complication after liver transplant for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) that is associated with poor survival. Biomarkers are needed to estimate recurrence risk before organ allocation. OBJECTIVE. This proof-of-concept study evaluated the use of machine learning (ML) to predict recurrence from pretreatment laboratory, clinical, and MRI data in patients with early-stage HCC initially eligible for liver transplant. METHODS. This retrospective study included 120 patients (88 men, 32 women; median age, 60.0 years) with early-stage HCC diagnosed who were initially eligible for liver transplant and underwent treatment by transplant, resection, or thermal ablation between June 2005 and March 2018. Patients underwent pretreatment MRI and posttreatment imaging surveillance. Imaging features were extracted from postcontrast phases of pretreatment MRI examinations using a pretrained convolutional neural network. Pretreatment clinical characteristics (including laboratory data) and extracted imaging features were integrated to develop three ML models (clinical model, imaging model, combined model) for predicting recurrence within six time frames ranging from 1 through 6 years after treatment. Kaplan-Meier analysis with time to recurrence as the endpoint was used to assess the clinical relevance of model predictions. RESULTS. Tumor recurred in 44 of 120 (36.7%) patients during follow-up. The three models predicted recurrence with AUCs across the six time frames of 0.60-0.78 (clinical model), 0.71-0.85 (imaging model), and 0.62-0.86 (combined model). The mean AUC was higher for the imaging model than the clinical model (0.76 vs 0.68, respectively; p = .03), but the mean AUC was not significantly different between the clinical and combined models or between the imaging and combined models (p &gt; .05). Kaplan-Meier curves were significantly different between patients predicted to be at low risk and those predicted to be at high risk by all three models for the 2-, 3-, 4-, 5-, and 6-year time frames (p &lt; .05). CONCLUSION. The findings suggest that ML-based models can predict recurrence before therapy allocation in patients with early-stage HCC initially eligible for liver transplant. Adding MRI data as model input improved predictive performance over clinical parameters alone. The combined model did not surpass the imaging model's performance. CLINICAL IMPACT. ML-based models applied to currently underutilized imaging features may help design more reliable criteria for organ allocation and liver transplant eligibility."
Prediction of COVID-19 Data Using Hybrid Modeling Approaches,other,"neural network, multilayer perceptron, recurrent neural network","A major emphasis is the dissemination of COVID-19 across the country's many regions and provinces. Using the present COVID-19 pandemic as a guide, the researchers suggest a hybrid model architecture for analyzing and optimizing COVID-19 data during the complete country. The analysis of COVID-19's exploration and death rate uses an ARIMA model with susceptible-infectious-removed and susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed (SEIR) models. The logistic model's failure to forecast the number of confirmed diagnoses and the snags of the SEIR model's too many tuning parameters are both addressed by a hybrid model method. Logistic regression (LR), Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average Model (ARIMA), support vector regression (SVR), multilayer perceptron (MLP), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), Gate Recurrent Unit (GRU), and long short-term memory (LSTM) are utilized for the same purpose. Root mean square error, mean absolute error, and mean absolute percentage error are used to show these models. New COVID-19 cases, the number of quarantines, mortality rates, and the deployment of public self-protection measures to reduce the epidemic are all outlined in the study's findings. Government officials can use the findings to guide future illness prevention and control choices."
Prediction of Metabolic Characteristics of Cardiovascular and Cerebrovascular Diseases Based on Convolutional Neural Network,other,"neural network, convolutional neural network","As a typical disease, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases cause great damage to the human body. In view of the problem that the existing models failed to describe and represent the characteristics of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular indicators, convolution neural network was used to analyze the metabolic factors of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular. Based on convolutional neural network theory, feature extraction was carried out on the relevant parameters of the model, and the change trend of different cardiovascular and cerebrovascular indicators was studied by model optimization, theoretical analysis, and experimental verification. Relevant studies show that the value of neurons increases slowly at first and then rapidly with the increase of bias term b. And with the increase of computing time, the corresponding nonlinear characteristics are gradually reflected; so, the influence of computing time on neuron results should be considered when selecting bias term b. The gradient changes under different functions have typical symmetry, which indicates that the effects of functions on model parameters have certain cyclic characteristics. Among them, ReLU function has the largest variation range, tanh function has a relatively small curve variation range, and sigmoid function has the smallest variation range. Five indicators are selected to describe the metabolic characteristics of the disease through characteristic analysis of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. The onset signs have the greatest impact on cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, while the corresponding metabolic characteristics have the least impact on cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. The study showed that the influence of different indicators on the model had typical stage characteristics, and relevant data were used to verify the accuracy of the model. Finally, the optimization model based on convolutional neural network was used to predict the metabolic characteristics of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. Relevant studies show that the optimization model can better analyze the metabolic characteristics of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. This research can provide theoretical support for the application of convolutional neural networks in other fields."
Forecasting daily Covid-19 cases in the world with a hybrid ARIMA and neural network model,other,neural network,"The use of models to predict disease cases is common in epidemiology and related areas, in the context of Covid-19, both ARIMA and Neural Network models can be applied for purposes of optimized resource management, so the aim of this study is to capture the linear and non-linear structures of daily Covid-19 cases in the world by using a hybrid forecasting model. In summary, the proposed hybrid system methodology consists of two steps. In the first step, an ARIMA model is used to analyze the linear part of the problem. In the second step, a neural network model is developed to model the residuals of the ARIMA model, which would be the non-linear part of it. The neural network model was superior to the ARIMA when considering the capture of weekly seasonality and in two weeks, the combination of models with the capture of seasonality in two weeks provided a mixed model with good error metrics, that allows actions to be premeditated with greater certainty, such as increasing the number of nurses in a location, or the acceleration of vaccination campaigns to diminish a possible increase in the number of cases."
Applying artificial neural-network model to predict psychiatric symptoms,other,"neural network, artificial neural network","INTRODUCTION: Mental disorders result in mental disabilities and discomfort in the affected person as they affect both thinking and behavior. Therefore, more vulnerable people must first be identified to improve the psychological level of society.

Ability to Predict Melanoma Within 5 Years Using Registry Data and a Convolutional Neural Network: A Proof of Concept Study,other,"neural network, convolutional neural network","Research relating to machine learning algorithms, including convolutional neural networks, has increased during the past 5 years. The aim of this pilot study was to investigate how accurately a convolutional neural network, trained on Swedish registry data, could perform in predicting cutaneous invasive and in situ melanoma (CMM) within 5 years. A cohort of 1,208,393 individuals was used. Registry data ranged from 4 July 2005 to 31 December 2011, predicting CMM between 1 January 2012 and 31 December 2016. A convolutional neural network with one-dimensional convolutions with respect to time was trained using healthcare databases and registers. The algorithm was trained on 23,886 individuals. Validation was performed on a holdout validation set including 6,000 individuals. After training and validation, the convolutional neural network was evaluated on a test set (1,000 individuals with an CMM occurring within 5 years and 5,000 without). The area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve was 0.59 (95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.57-0.61). The point on the receiver-operating characteristic curve where sensitivity equalled specificity had a value of 56% (sensitivity 95% CI 53-60% and specificity 95% CI 55-58%). Albeit at an early stage, this pilot investigation demonstrates potential usefulness for machine learning algorithms in predicting melanoma risk."
A goodness-of-fit test based on neural network sieve estimators,other,neural network,"Neural networks have become increasingly popular in the field of machine learning and have been successfully used in many applied fields (e.g., imaging recognition). With more and more research has been conducted on neural networks, we have a better understanding of the statistical proprieties of neural networks. While many studies focus on bounding the prediction error of neural network estimators, limited research has been done on the statistical inference of neural networks. From a statistical point of view, it is of great interest to investigate the statistical inference of neural networks as it could facilitate hypothesis testing in many fields (e.g., genetics, epidemiology, and medical science). In this paper, we propose a goodness-of-fit test statistic based on neural network sieve estimators. The test statistic follows an asymptotic distribution, which makes it easy to use in practice. We have also verified the theoretical asymptotic results via simulation studies and a real data application."
Development and internal validation of a machine-learning-developed model for predicting 1-year mortality after fragility hip fracture,other,"neural network, artificial neural network, machine learning model","BACKGROUND: Fragility hip fracture increases morbidity and mortality in older adult patients, especially within the first year. Identification of patients at high risk of death facilitates modification of associated perioperative factors that can reduce mortality. Various machine learning algorithms have been developed and are widely used in healthcare research, particularly for mortality prediction. This study aimed to develop and internally validate 7 machine learning models to predict 1-year mortality after fragility hip fracture.
METHODS: This retrospective study included patients with fragility hip fractures from a single center (Siriraj Hospital, Bangkok, Thailand) from July 2016 to October 2018. A total of 492 patients were enrolled. They were randomly categorized into a training group (344 cases, 70%) or a testing group (148 cases, 30%). Various machine learning techniques were used: the Gradient Boosting Classifier (GB), Random Forests Classifier (RF), Artificial Neural Network Classifier (ANN), Logistic Regression Classifier (LR), Naive Bayes Classifier (NB), Support Vector Machine Classifier (SVM), and K-Nearest Neighbors Classifier (KNN). All models were internally validated by evaluating their performance and the area under a receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC).
RESULTS: For the testing dataset, the accuracies were GB model = 0.93, RF model = 0.95, ANN model = 0.94, LR model = 0.91, NB model = 0.89, SVM model = 0.90, and KNN model = 0.90. All models achieved high AUCs that ranged between 0.81 and 0.99. The RF model also provided a negative predictive value of 0.96, a positive predictive value of 0.93, a specificity of 0.99, and a sensitivity of 0.68.
CONCLUSIONS: Our machine learning approach facilitated the successful development of an accurate model to predict 1-year mortality after fragility hip fracture. Several machine learning algorithms (eg, Gradient Boosting and Random Forest) had the potential to provide high predictive performance based on the clinical parameters of each patient. The web application is available at www.hipprediction.com . External validation in a larger group of patients or in different hospital settings is warranted to evaluate the clinical utility of this tool.

"A multivariate multi-step LSTM forecasting model for tuberculosis incidence with model explanation in Liaoning Province, China",other,None,"BACKGROUND: Tuberculosis (TB) is the respiratory infectious disease with the highest incidence in China. We aim to design a series of forecasting models and find the factors that affect the incidence of TB, thereby improving the accuracy of the incidence prediction.
RESULTS: In this paper, we developed a new interpretable prediction system based on the multivariate multi-step Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model and SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) method. Four accuracy measures are introduced into the system: Root Mean Square Error, Mean Absolute Error, Mean Absolute Percentage Error, and symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error. The Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model and seasonal ARIMA model are established. The multi-step ARIMA-LSTM model is proposed for the first time to examine the performance of each model in the short, medium, and long term, respectively. Compared with the ARIMA model, each error of the multivariate 2-step LSTM model is reduced by 12.92%, 15.94%, 15.97%, and 14.81% in the short term. The 3-step ARIMA-LSTM model achieved excellent performance, with each error decreased to 15.19%, 33.14%, 36.79%, and 29.76% in the medium and long term. We provide the local and global explanation of the multivariate single-step LSTM model in the field of incidence prediction, pioneering.
CONCLUSIONS: The multivariate 2-step LSTM model is suitable for short-term prediction and obtained a similar performance as previous studies. The 3-step ARIMA-LSTM model is appropriate for medium-to-long-term prediction and outperforms these models. The SHAP results indicate that the five most crucial features are maximum temperature, average relative humidity, local financial budget, monthly sunshine percentage, and sunshine hours."
Covariate adjustment of spirometric and smoking phenotypes: The potential of neural network models,other,neural network,"To increase power and minimize bias in statistical analyses, quantitative outcomes are often adjusted for precision and confounding variables using standard regression approaches. The outcome is modeled as a linear function of the precision variables and confounders; however, for many complex phenotypes, the assumptions of the linear regression models are not always met. As an alternative, we used neural networks for the modeling of complex phenotypes and covariate adjustments. We compared the prediction accuracy of the neural network models to that of classical approaches based on linear regression. Using data from the UK Biobank, COPDGene study, and Childhood Asthma Management Program (CAMP), we examined the features of neural networks in this context and compared them with traditional regression approaches for prediction of three outcomes: forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), age at smoking cessation, and log transformation of age at smoking cessation (due to age at smoking cessation being right-skewed). We used mean squared error to compare neural network and regression models, and found the models performed similarly unless the observed distribution of the phenotype was skewed, in which case the neural network had smaller mean squared error. Our results suggest neural network models have an advantage over standard regression approaches when the phenotypic distribution is skewed. However, when the distribution is not skewed, the approaches performed similarly. Our findings are relevant to studies that analyze phenotypes that are skewed by nature or where the phenotype of interest is skewed as a result of the ascertainment condition."
A Translational Model to Improve Early Detection of Epithelial Ovarian Cancers,other,neural network,"Neural network analyses of circulating miRNAs have shown potential as non-invasive screening tests for ovarian cancer. A clinically useful test would detect occult disease when complete cytoreduction is most feasible. Here we used murine xenografts to sensitize a neural network model to detect low volume disease and applied the model to sera from 75 early-stage ovarian cancer cases age-matched to 200 benign adnexal masses or healthy controls. The 14-miRNA model efficiently discriminated tumor bearing animals from controls with 100% sensitivity down to tumor inoculums of 50,000 cells. Among early-stage patient samples, the model performed well with 73% sensitivity at 91% specificity. Applied to a population with 1% disease prevalence, we hypothesize the model would detect most early-stage ovarian cancers while maintaining a negative predictive value of 99.97% (95% CI 99.95%-99.98%). Overall, this supports the concept that miRNAs may be useful as screening markers for early-stage disease."
A novel multivariable time series prediction model for acute kidney injury in general hospitalization,other,"neural network, machine learning model, recurrent neural network","OBJECTIVE: Early recognition and prevention are important to reduce the risk of acute kidney injury (AKI). We aimed to build a novel multivariate time series prediction model for dynamic AKI prediction in general hospitalization.
METHODS: Deidentified electronic data of all patients admitted in Sichuan Provincial Peoples Hospital during 1 January 2019 and 31 December 2019 was retrospectively collected. Variables including demographics, admission variables, lab investigation variables and prescription variables were extracted. The first 50 most frequently detected lab investigation variables were selected as the predictive variables. Features within three previous days were selected to predict the risk of AKI in the next 24 h. The model was built using recurrent neural network (RNN) algorithm integrated with a time series convolution module and an attention convolution module and internally validated using five-fold cross-validation. Area under the ROC curve (AUC) and recall rate were used to evaluate the performance. The model was compared with four other models built using other machine learning algorithms and published machine learning models in literature.
RESULTS: 47,960 eligible admissions were identified, among which 2694 (5.6%) admissions were complicated by AKI. Our model has an AUC of 0.908 and a recall rate of 0.869, outperforming models generated by mainstay machine learning methods and most of the published machine learning models.
CONCLUSION: This study reports a novel machine learning prediction model for AKI in general hospitalization which is based on RNN algorithm. The model outperforms models generated by mainstay machine learning methods and most of the published machine learning models."
PREDICTION OF HEREDITARY CANCERS USING NEURAL NETWORKS,other,"neural network, convolutional neural network","Family history is a major risk factor for many types of cancer. Mendelian risk prediction models translate family histories into cancer risk predictions, based on knowledge of cancer susceptibility genes. These models are widely used in clinical practice to help identify high-risk individuals. Mendelian models leverage the entire family history, but they rely on many assumptions about cancer susceptibility genes that are either unrealistic or challenging to validate, due to low mutation prevalence. Training more flexible models, such as neural networks, on large databases of pedigrees can potentially lead to accuracy gains. In this paper we develop a framework to apply neural networks to family history data and investigate their ability to learn inherited susceptibility to cancer. While there is an extensive literature on neural networks and their state-of-the-art performance in many tasks, there is little work applying them to family history data. We propose adaptations of fully-connected neural networks and convolutional neural networks to pedigrees. In data simulated under Mendelian inheritance, we demonstrate that our proposed neural network models are able to achieve nearly optimal prediction performance. Moreover, when the observed family history includes misreported cancer diagnoses, neural networks are able to outperform the Mendelian BRCAPRO model embedding the correct inheritance laws. Using a large dataset of over 200,000 family histories, the Risk Service cohort, we train prediction models for future risk of breast cancer. We validate the models using data from the Cancer Genetics Network."
Analysis and modeling of COVID-19 epidemic dynamics in Saudi Arabia using SIR-PSO and machine learning approaches,other,"neural network, artificial neural network","INTRODUCTION: COVID-19 has become a global concern because it has extensive damage to health, social and economic systems worldwide. Consequently, there is an urgent need to develop tools to understand, analyze, monitor and control further outbreaks of the disease.
METHODOLOGY: The Susceptible Infected Recovered-Particle SwarmOptimization model and the feed-forward artificial neural network model were separately developed to model COVID-19 dynamics based on daily time-series data reported by the Saudi authorities from March 2, 2020 to February 21, 2021. The collected data were divided into training and validation datasets. The effectiveness of the investigated models was evaluated by using various performance metrics. The Susceptible-Infected-Recovered-Particle-Swarm-Optimization model was found to well predict the cumulative infected and recovered cases and to optimally tune the contact rate and the characteristic duration of the illness. The feed-forward artificial neural network model was found to be efficient in modeling daily new and cumulative infections, recoveries and deaths.
RESULTS: The forecasts provided by the investigated models had high coefficient of determination values of more than 0.97 and low mean absolute percentage errors (around 7% on average).
CONCLUSIONS: Both the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered-Particle-Swarm-Optimization and feed-forward artificial neural network models were efficient in modeling COVID-19 dynamics in Saudi Arabia. The results produced by the models can help the Saudi health authorities to analyze the virus dynamics and prepare efficient measures to control any future occurrence of the epidemic."
A comparative analysis of machine learning approaches to predict C. difficile infection in hospitalized patients,other,"neural network, convolutional neural network","BACKGROUND: Interventions to better prevent or manage Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) may significantly reduce morbidity, mortality, and healthcare spending.
METHODS: We present a retrospective study using electronic health record data from over 700 United States hospitals. A subset of hospitals was used to develop machine learning algorithms (MLAs); the remaining hospitals served as an external test set. Three MLAs were evaluated: gradient-boosted decision trees (XGBoost), Deep Long Short Term Memory neural network, and one-dimensional convolutional neural network. MLA performance was evaluated with area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), sensitivity, specificity, diagnostic odds ratios and likelihood ratios.
RESULTS: The development dataset contained 13,664,840 inpatient encounters with 80,046 CDI encounters; the external dataset contained 1,149,088 inpatient encounters with 7,107 CDI encounters. The highest AUROCs were achieved for XGB, Deep Long Short Term Memory neural network, and one-dimensional convolutional neural network via abstaining from use of specialized training techniques, resampling in isolation, and resampling and output bias in combination, respectively. XGBoost achieved the highest AUROC.
CONCLUSIONS: MLAs can predict future CDI in hospitalized patients using just 6 hours of data. In clinical practice, a machine-learning based tool may support prophylactic measures, earlier diagnosis, and more timely implementation of infection control measures."
Neural networks for clustered and longitudinal data using mixed effects models,other,"neural network, feedforward neural network","Although most statistical methods for the analysis of longitudinal data have focused on retrospective models of association, new advances in mobile health data have presented opportunities for predicting future health status by leveraging an individual's behavioral history alongside data from similar patients. Methods that incorporate both individual-level and sample-level effects are critical to using these data to its full predictive capacity. Neural networks are powerful tools for prediction, but many assume input observations are independent even when they are clustered or correlated in some way, such as in longitudinal data. Generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) provide a flexible framework for modeling longitudinal data but have poor predictive power particularly when the data are highly nonlinear. We propose a generalized neural network mixed model that replaces the linear fixed effect in a GLMM with the output of a feed-forward neural network. The model simultaneously accounts for the correlation structure and complex nonlinear relationship between input variables and outcomes, and it utilizes the predictive power of neural networks. We apply this approach to predict depression and anxiety levels of schizophrenic patients using longitudinal data collected from passive smartphone sensor data."
[A comparative study of time series models in predicting COVID-19 cases],other,"neural network, recurrent neural network","Objective: To compare the performances of different time series models in predicting COVID-19 in different countries. Methods: We collected the daily confirmed case numbers of COVID-19 in the USA, India, and Brazil from April 1 to September 30, 2020, and then constructed an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model and a recurrent neural network (RNN) model, respectively. We applied the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and root mean square error (RMSE) to compare the performances of the two models in predicting the case numbers from September 21 to September 30, 2020.

Conclusions: The performance of the prediction models varied with country. The ARIMA model had a better prediction performance for COVID-19 in the USA and Brazil, while the RNN model was more suitable in India."
The new SUMPOT to predict postoperative complications using an Artificial Neural Network,other,"neural network, artificial neural network","An accurate assessment of preoperative risk may improve use of hospital resources and reduce morbidity and mortality in high-risk surgical patients. This study aims at implementing an automated surgical risk calculator based on Artificial Neural Network technology to identify patients at risk for postoperative complications. We developed the new SUMPOT based on risk factors previously used in other scoring systems and tested it in a cohort of 560 surgical patients undergoing elective or emergency procedures and subsequently admitted to intensive care units, high-dependency units or standard wards. The whole dataset was divided into a training set, to train the predictive model, and a testing set, to assess generalization performance. The effectiveness of the Artificial Neural Network is a measure of the accuracy in detecting those patients who will develop postoperative complications. A total of 560 surgical patients entered the analysis. Among them, 77 patients (13.7%) suffered from one or more postoperative complications (PoCs), while 483 patients (86.3%) did not. The trained Artificial Neural Network returned an average classification accuracy of 90% in the testing set. Specifically, classification accuracy was 90.2% in the control group (46 patients out of 51 were correctly classified) and 88.9% in the PoC group (8 patients out of 9 were correctly classified). The Artificial Neural Network showed good performance in predicting presence/absence of postoperative complications, suggesting its potential value for perioperative management of surgical patients. Further clinical studies are required to confirm its applicability in routine clinical practice."

We develop a feed-forward neural network, a long short-term memory recurrent neural network, and a gated recurrent unit network. We evaluate the networks in their ability to replicate the spatiotemporal features of mosquito populations predicted by the mechanistic model, and discuss how augmenting the training data with time series that emphasize specific dynamical behaviors affects model performance. We conclude with an outlook on how such equation-free models may facilitate vector control or the estimation of disease risk at arbitrary spatial scales."
Obesity Mass Monitoring in Medical Big Data Based on High-Order Simulated Annealing Neural Network Algorithm,other,neural network,"With the rapid development of information technology, hospital informatization has become the general trend. In this context, disease monitoring based on medical big data has been proposed and has aroused widespread concern. In order to overcome the shortcomings of the BP neural network, such as slow convergence speed and easy to fall into local extremum, simulated annealing algorithm is used to optimize the BP neural network and high-order simulated annealing neural network algorithm is constructed. After screening the potential target indicators using the random forest algorithm, based on medical big data, the experiment uses high-order simulated annealing neural network algorithm to establish the obesity monitoring model to realize obesity monitoring and prevention. The results show that the training times of the SA-BP neural network are 1480 times lower than those of the BP neural network, and the mean square error of the SA-BP neural network is 3.43 times lower than that of the BP neural network. The MAE of the SA-BP neural network is 1.81 times lower than that of the BP neural network, and the average output error of the obesity monitoring model is about 2.35 at each temperature. After training, the average accuracy of the obesity monitoring model was 98.7%. The above results show that the obesity monitoring model based on medical big data can effectively complete the monitoring of obesity and has a certain contribution to the diagnosis, treatment, and early warning of obesity."
Explainable machine learning model for predicting spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in cirrhotic patients with ascites,other,machine learning model,"Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) is a life-threatening complication in patients with cirrhosis. We aimed to develop an explainable machine learning model to achieve the early prediction and outcome interpretation of SBP. We used CatBoost algorithm to construct MODEL-1 with 46 variables. After dimensionality reduction, we constructed MODEL-2. We calculated and compared the sensitivity and negative predictive value (NPV) of MODEL-1 and MODEL-2. Finally, we used the SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) method to provide insights into the model's outcome or prediction. MODEL-2 (AUROC: 0.822; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.783-0.856), liked MODEL-1 (AUROC: 0.822; 95% CI 0.784-0.856), could well predict the risk of SBP in cirrhotic ascites patients. The 6 most influential predictive variables were total protein, C-reactive protein, prothrombin activity, cholinesterase, lymphocyte ratio and apolipoprotein A1. For binary classifier, the sensitivity and NPV of MODEL-1 were 0.894 and 0.885, respectively, while for MODEL-2 they were 0.927 and 0.904, respectively. We applied CatBoost algorithm to establish a practical and explainable prediction model for risk of SBP in cirrhotic patients with ascites. We also identified 6 important variables closely related to the occurrence of SBP."
A Novel Matrix Profile-Guided Attention LSTM Model for Forecasting COVID-19 Cases in USA,other,"neural network, recurrent neural network","Background: The outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been raging around the world for more than 1 year. Analysis of previous COVID-19 data is useful to explore its epidemic patterns. Utilizing data mining and machine learning methods for COVID-19 forecasting might provide a better insight into the trends of COVID-19 cases. This study aims to model the COVID-19 cases and perform forecasting of three important indicators of COVID-19 in the United States of America (USA), which are the adjusted percentage of daily admitted hospitalized COVID-19 cases (hospital admission), the number of daily confirmed COVID-19 cases (confirmed cases), and the number of daily death cases caused by COVID-19 (death cases). Materials and Methods: The actual COVID-19 data from March 1, 2020 to August 5, 2021 were obtained from Carnegie Mellon University Delphi Research Group. A novel forecasting algorithm was proposed to model and predict the three indicators. This algorithm is a hybrid of an unsupervised time series anomaly detection technique called matrix profile and an attention-based long short-term memory (LSTM) model. Several classic statistical models and the baseline recurrent neural network (RNN) models were used as the baseline models. All models were evaluated using a repeated holdout training and test strategy. Results: The proposed matrix profile-assisted attention-based LSTM model performed the best among all the compared models, which has the root mean square error (RMSE) = 1.23, 31612.81, 467.17, mean absolute error (MAE) = 0.95, 26259.55, 364.02, and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) = 0.25, 1.06, 0.55, for hospital admission, confirmed cases, and death cases, respectively. Conclusion: The proposed model is more powerful in forecasting COVID-19 cases. It can potentially aid policymakers in making prevention plans and guide health care managers to allocate health care resources reasonably."
COVID-19 mortality rate prediction for India using statistical neural networks and gaussian process regression model,other,neural network,"The primary purpose of this research is to identify the best COVID-19 mortality model for India using regression models and is to estimate the future COVID-19 mortality rate for India. Specifically, Statistical Neural Networks (Radial Basis Function Neural Network (RBFNN), Generalized Regression Neural Network (GRNN)), and Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) are applied to develop the COVID-19 Mortality Rate Prediction (MRP) model for India. For that purpose, there are two types of dataset used in this study: One is COVID-19 Death cases, a Time Series Data and the other is COVID-19 Confirmed Case and Death Cases where Death case is dependent variable and the Confirmed case is an independent variable. Hyperparameter optimization or tuning is used in these regression models, which is the process of identifying a set of optimal hyperparameters for any learning process with minimal error. Here, sigma (σ) is a hyperparameter whose value is used to constrain the learning process of the above models with minimum Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). The performance of the models is evaluated using the RMSE and 'R2 values, which shows that the GRP model performs better than the GRNN and RBFNN."
Prediction of seroma after total mastectomy using an artificial neural network algorithm,other,"neural network, artificial neural network","Seroma is a common complication after mastectomy. To the best of our knowledge, no prediction models have been developed for this. Henceforth, medical records of total mastectomy patients were retrospectively reviewed. Data consisting of 120 subjects were divided into a training-validation data set (96 subjects) and a testing data set (24 subjects). Data was learned by using a 9-layer artificial neural network (ANN), and the model was validated using 10-fold cross-validation. The model performance was assessed by a confusion matrix in the validating data set. The receiver operating characteristic curve was constructed, and the area under the curve (AUC) was also calculated. Pathology type, presence of hypertension, presence of diabetes, receiving of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, body mass index, and axillary lymph node (LN) management (i.e., sentinel LN biopsy and axillary LN dissection) were selected as predictive factors in a model developed from the neural network algorithm. The model yielded an AUC of 0.760, which corresponded with a level of acceptable discrimination. Sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and positive and negative predictive values were 100%, 52.9%, 66.7%, 46.7%, and 100%, respectively. Our model, which was developed from the ANN algorithm can predict seroma after total mastectomy with high sensitivity. Nevertheless, external validation is still needed to confirm the performance of this model."
Explainable Artificial Intelligence Model for Diagnosis of Atrial Fibrillation Using Holter Electrocardiogram Waveforms,other,"neural network, machine learning model, convolutional neural network","Atrial fibrillation is a clinically important arrhythmia. There are some reports on machine learning models for AF diagnosis using electrocardiogram data. However, few reports have proposed an eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) model to enable physicians to easily understand the machine learning model's diagnosis results.We developed and validated an XAI-enabled atrial fibrillation diagnosis model based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithm. We used Holter electrocardiogram monitoring data and the gradient-weighted class activation mapping (Grad-CAM) method.Electrocardiogram data recorded from patients between January 4, 2016, and October 31, 2019, totaling 57,273 electrocardiogram waveform slots of 30 seconds each with diagnostic information annotated by cardiologists, were used for training our proposed model. Performance metrics of our AI model for AF diagnosis are as follows: sensitivity, 97.1% (95% CI: 0.969-0.972); specificity, 94.5% (95% CI: 0.943-0.946); accuracy, 95.3% (95% CI: 0.952-0.955); positive predictive value, 89.3% (95% CI: 0.892-0.897); and F-value, 93.1% (95% CI: 0.929-0.933). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for AF detection using our model was 0.988 (95% CI: 0.987-0.988). Furthermore, using the XAI method, 94.5 ± 3.5% of the areas identified as regions of interest using our machine learning model were identified as characteristic sites for AF diagnosis by cardiologists.AF was accurately diagnosed and favorably explained with Holter ECG waveforms using our proposed CNN-based XAI model. Our study presents another step toward realizing a viable XAI-based detection model for AF diagnoses for use by physicians."
Prediction of premature all-cause mortality in patients receiving peritoneal dialysis using modified artificial neural networks,other,"neural network, artificial neural network","Premature all-cause mortality is high in patients receiving peritoneal dialysis (PD). The accurate and early prediction of mortality is critical and difficult. Three prediction models, the logistic regression (LR) model, artificial neural network (ANN) classic model and a new structured ANN model (ANN mixed model), were constructed and evaluated using a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. The permutation feature importance was used to interpret the important features in the ANN models. Eight hundred fifty-nine patients were enrolled in the study. The LR model performed slightly better than the other two ANN models on the test dataset; however, in the total dataset, the ANN models fit much better. The ANN mixed model showed the best prediction performance, with area under the ROC curves (AUROCs) of 0.8 and 0.79 for the 6-month and 12-month datasets. Our study showed that age, diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c) levels were common risk factors for premature mortality in patients receiving PD. Our ANN mixed model had incomparable advantages in fitting the overall data characteristics, and age is a steady risk factor for premature mortality in patients undergoing PD. Otherwise, DBP and LDL-c levels should receive more attention for all-cause mortality during follow-up."
Predicting the Dynamics of the COVID-19 Pandemic in the United States Using Graph Theory-Based Neural Networks,other,neural network,"The COVID-19 pandemic has had unprecedented social and economic consequences in the United States. Therefore, accurately predicting the dynamics of the pandemic can be very beneficial. Two main elements required for developing reliable predictions include: (1) a predictive model and (2) an indicator of the current condition and status of the pandemic. As a pandemic indicator, we used the effective reproduction number (Rt), which is defined as the number of new infections transmitted by a single contagious individual in a population that may no longer be fully susceptible. To bring the pandemic under control, Rt must be less than one. To eliminate the pandemic, Rt should be close to zero. Therefore, this value may serve as a strong indicator of the current status of the pandemic. For a predictive model, we used graph neural networks (GNNs), a method that combines graphical analysis with the structure of neural networks. We developed two types of GNN models, including: (1) graph-theory-based neural networks (GTNN) and (2) neighborhood-based neural networks (NGNN). The nodes in both graphs indicated individual states in the United States. While the GTNN model's edges document functional connectivity between states, those in the NGNN model link neighboring states to one another. We trained both models with R<sub>t</sub> numbers collected over the previous four days and asked them to predict the following day for all states in the United States. The performance of these models was evaluated with the datasets that included R<sub>t</sub> values reflecting conditions from 22 January through 26 November 2020 (before the start of COVID-19 vaccination in the United States). To determine the efficiency, we compared the results of two models with each other and with those generated by a baseline Long short-term memory (LSTM) model. The results indicated that the GTNN model outperformed both the NGNN and LSTM models for predicting Rt."
Based on biomedical index data: Risk prediction model for prostate cancer,other,"neural network, artificial neural network","To explore the influencing factors of prostate cancer occurrence, set up risk prediction model, require reference for the preliminary diagnosis of clinical doctors, this model searched database through the data of prostate cancer patients and prostate hyperplasia patients National Clinical Medical Science Data Center.With the help of Stata SE 12.0 and SPSS 25.0 software, the biases between groups were balanced by propensity score matching. Based on the matched data, the relevant factors were further screened by stepwise logistic regression analysis, the key variable and artificial neural network model are established. The prediction accuracy of the model is evaluated by combining the probability of test set with the area under receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC).After 1:2 PSM, 339 pairs were matched successfully. There are 159 cases in testing groups and 407 cases in training groups. And the regression model was P = 1 / (1 + e (0.122 ∗ age + 0.083 ∗ Apo lipoprotein C3 + 0.371 ∗ total prostate specific antigen (tPSA) -0.227 ∗ Apo lipoprotein C2-6.093 ∗ free calcium (iCa) + 0.428 ∗ Apo lipoprotein E-1.246 ∗ triglyceride-1.919 ∗ HDL cholesterol + 0.083 ∗ creatine kinase isoenzyme [CKMB])). The logistic regression model performed very well (ROC, 0.963; 95% confidence interval, 0.951 to 0.978) and artificial neural network model (ROC, 0.983; 95% confidence interval, 0.964 to 0.997). High degree of Apo lipoprotein E (Apo E) (Odds Ratio, [OR], 1.535) in blood test is a risk factor and high triglyceride (TG) (OR, 0.288) is a protective factor.It takes the biochemical examination of the case as variables to establish a risk prediction model, which can initially reflect the risk of prostate cancer and bring some references for diagnosis and treatment."
Application of artificial neural network in predicting EI,other,"neural network, artificial neural network","UNLABELLED: Emotional intelligence (EI) constitutes a whole set of non-cognitive capabilities, competencies, and skills that affect one's ability to deal successfully with environmental demands and pressures. Different factors such as gender, age, education, place of residence, etc. can influence this variable. Nevertheless, the influence of a multitude of factors involved in behavioral phenomena cannot often be controlled.
PURPOSE: Therefore, some difficulty may often raise in finding associations between these variables using regression models as regression models are built on restrictive assumptions.
METHODS: In these cases, models such as artificial neural networks are excellent alternatives to regression models. In this study, the neural network model was used in SPSS software to predict the pattern held among the variables of age, gender, occupation, marital status, and education for predicting the EI of 901 individuals aged from 17 to 73 years.
RESULTS: The appropriate neural network model for EI prediction is a hyperbolic tangent transfer function with two neurons in the hidden layer and a sigmoid transfer function in the output layer. This network was able to predict EI in most of its dimensions with significant correlations and could demonstrate the neural network's advantage over regression models in predicting EI using sociological variables.
CONCLUSION: This model is able to estimate the EI level in different occupational, educational, gender, and age groups, and provide the ground for planning to address potential deficiencies in each group."
Use of Machine Learning Models to Predict Death After Acute Myocardial Infarction,other,"neural network, machine learning model","IMPORTANCE: Accurate prediction of adverse outcomes after acute myocardial infarction (AMI) can guide the triage of care services and shared decision-making, and novel methods hold promise for using existing data to generate additional insights.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether contemporary machine learning methods can facilitate risk prediction by including a larger number of variables and identifying complex relationships between predictors and outcomes.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cohort study used the American College of Cardiology Chest Pain-MI Registry to identify all AMI hospitalizations between January 1, 2011, and December 31, 2016. Data analysis was performed from February 1, 2018, to October 22, 2020.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Three machine learning models were developed and validated to predict in-hospital mortality based on patient comorbidities, medical history, presentation characteristics, and initial laboratory values. Models were developed based on extreme gradient descent boosting (XGBoost, an interpretable model), a neural network, and a meta-classifier model. Their accuracy was compared against the current standard developed using a logistic regression model in a validation sample.
RESULTS: A total of 755 402 patients (mean [SD] age, 65 [13] years; 495 202 [65.5%] male) were identified during the study period. In independent validation, 2 machine learning models, gradient descent boosting and meta-classifier (combination including inputs from gradient descent boosting and a neural network), marginally improved discrimination compared with logistic regression (C statistic, 0.90 for best performing machine learning model vs 0.89 for logistic regression). Nearly perfect calibration in independent validation data was found in the XGBoost (slope of predicted to observed events, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.99-1.04) and the meta-classifier model (slope of predicted-to-observed events, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.99-1.02), with more precise classification across the risk spectrum. The XGBoost model reclassified 32 393 of 121 839 individuals (27%) and the meta-classifier model reclassified 30 836 of 121 839 individuals (25%) deemed at moderate to high risk for death in logistic regression as low risk, which were more consistent with the observed event rates.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cohort study using a large national registry, none of the tested machine learning models were associated with substantive improvement in the discrimination of in-hospital mortality after AMI, limiting their clinical utility. However, compared with logistic regression, XGBoost and meta-classifier models, but not the neural network, offered improved resolution of risk for high-risk individuals."
Prediction and control of COVID-19 spreading based on a hybrid intelligent model,other,None,"The coronavirus (COVID-19) is a highly infectious disease that emerged in the late December 2019 in Wuhan, China. It caused a worldwide outbreak and a major threat to global health. It is important to design prediction and control strategies to restrain its exploding. In this study, a hybrid intelligent model is proposed to simulate the spreading of COVID-19. First, considering the effect of control measures, such as government investment, media publicity, medical treatment, and law enforcement in epidemic spreading. Then, the infection rates are optimized by genetic algorithm (GA) and a modified susceptible-infected-quarantined-recovered (SIQR) epidemic spreading model is proposed. In addition, the long short-term memory (LSTM) is imbedded into the SIQR model to design the hybrid intelligent model to further optimize other parameters of the system model, which can obtain the optimal predictive model and control measures. Simulation results show that the proposed hybrid intelligence algorithm has good predictive ability. This study provide a reliable model to predict cases of infection and death, and reasonable suggestion to control COVID-19."
Machine learning predictive model for severe COVID-19,other,"neural network, artificial neural network","To develop a modified predictive model for severe COVID-19 in people infected with Sars-Cov-2. We developed the predictive model for severe patients of COVID-19 based on the clinical date from the Tumor Center of Union Hospital affiliated with Tongji Medical College, China. A total of 151 cases from Jan. 26 to Mar. 20, 2020, were included. Then we followed 5 steps to predict and evaluate the model: data preprocessing, data splitting, feature selection, model building, prevention of overfitting, and Evaluation, and combined with artificial neural network algorithms. We processed the results in the 5 steps. In feature selection, ALB showed a strong negative correlation (r = 0.771, P < 0.001) whereas GLB (r = 0.661, P < 0.001) and BUN (r = 0.714, P < 0.001) showed a strong positive correlation with severity of COVID-19. TensorFlow was subsequently applied to develop a neural network model. The model achieved good prediction performance, with an area under the curve value of 0.953(0.889-0.982). Our results showed its outstanding performance in prediction. GLB and BUN may be two risk factors for severe COVID-19. Our findings could be of great benefit in the future treatment of patients with COVID-19 and will help to improve the quality of care in the long term. This model has great significance to rationalize early clinical interventions and improve the cure rate."
Assessing the International Transferability of a Machine Learning Model for Detecting Medication Error in the General Internal Medicine Clinic: Multicenter Preliminary Validation Study,other,machine learning model,"BACKGROUND: Although most current medication error prevention systems are rule-based, these systems may result in alert fatigue because of poor accuracy. Previously, we had developed a machine learning (ML) model based on Taiwan's local databases (TLD) to address this issue. However, the international transferability of this model is unclear.
OBJECTIVE: This study examines the international transferability of a machine learning model for detecting medication errors and whether the federated learning approach could further improve the accuracy of the model.
METHODS: The study cohort included 667,572 outpatient prescriptions from 2 large US academic medical centers. Our ML model was applied to build the original model (O model), the local model (L model), and the hybrid model (H model). The O model was built using the data of 1.34 billion outpatient prescriptions from TLD. A validation set with 8.98% (60,000/667,572) of the prescriptions was first randomly sampled, and the remaining 91.02% (607,572/667,572) of the prescriptions served as the local training set for the L model. With a federated learning approach, the H model used the association values with a higher frequency of co-occurrence among the O and L models. A testing set with 600 prescriptions was classified as substantiated and unsubstantiated by 2 independent physician reviewers and was then used to assess model performance.
RESULTS: The interrater agreement was significant in terms of classifying prescriptions as substantiated and unsubstantiated (κ=0.91; 95% CI 0.88 to 0.95). With thresholds ranging from 0.5 to 1.5, the alert accuracy ranged from 75%-78% for the O model, 76%-78% for the L model, and 79%-85% for the H model.
CONCLUSIONS: Our ML model has good international transferability among US hospital data. Using the federated learning approach with local hospital data could further improve the accuracy of the model."
Applying probability calibration to ensemble methods to predict 2-year mortality in patients with DLBCL,other,"neural network, feedforward neural network","BACKGROUND: Under the influences of chemotherapy regimens, clinical staging, immunologic expressions and other factors, the survival rates of patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) are different. The accurate prediction of mortality hazards is key to precision medicine, which can help clinicians make optimal therapeutic decisions to extend the survival times of individual patients with DLBCL. Thus, we have developed a predictive model to predict the mortality hazard of DLBCL patients within 2 years of treatment.
METHODS: We evaluated 406 patients with DLBCL and collected 17 variables from each patient. The predictive variables were selected by the Cox model, the logistic model and the random forest algorithm. Five classifiers were chosen as the base models for ensemble learning: the naïve Bayes, logistic regression, random forest, support vector machine and feedforward neural network models. We first calibrated the biased outputs from the five base models by using probability calibration methods (including shape-restricted polynomial regression, Platt scaling and isotonic regression). Then, we aggregated the outputs from the various base models to predict the 2-year mortality of DLBCL patients by using three strategies (stacking, simple averaging and weighted averaging). Finally, we assessed model performance over 300 hold-out tests.
RESULTS: Gender, stage, IPI, KPS and rituximab were significant factors for predicting the deaths of DLBCL patients within 2 years of treatment. The stacking model that first calibrated the base model by shape-restricted polynomial regression performed best (AUC = 0.820, ECE = 8.983, MCE = 21.265) in all methods. In contrast, the performance of the stacking model without undergoing probability calibration is inferior (AUC = 0.806, ECE = 9.866, MCE = 24.850). In the simple averaging model and weighted averaging model, the prediction error of the ensemble model also decreased with probability calibration.
CONCLUSIONS: Among all the methods compared, the proposed model has the lowest prediction error when predicting the 2-year mortality of DLBCL patients. These promising results may indicate that our modeling strategy of applying probability calibration to ensemble learning is successful."
An Artificial Intelligence Model to Predict the Mortality of COVID-19 Patients at Hospital Admission Time Using Routine Blood Samples: Development and Validation of an Ensemble Model,other,neural network,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19, which is accompanied by acute respiratory distress, multiple organ failure, and death, has spread worldwide much faster than previously thought. However, at present, it has limited treatments.
OBJECTIVE: To overcome this issue, we developed an artificial intelligence (AI) model of COVID-19, named EDRnet (ensemble learning model based on deep neural network and random forest models), to predict in-hospital mortality using a routine blood sample at the time of hospital admission.
METHODS: We selected 28 blood biomarkers and used the age and gender information of patients as model inputs. To improve the mortality prediction, we adopted an ensemble approach combining deep neural network and random forest models. We trained our model with a database of blood samples from 361 COVID-19 patients in Wuhan, China, and applied it to 106 COVID-19 patients in three Korean medical institutions.
RESULTS: In the testing data sets, EDRnet provided high sensitivity (100%), specificity (91%), and accuracy (92%). To extend the number of patient data points, we developed a web application (BeatCOVID19) where anyone can access the model to predict mortality and can register his or her own blood laboratory results.
CONCLUSIONS: Our new AI model, EDRnet, accurately predicts the mortality rate for COVID-19. It is publicly available and aims to help health care providers fight COVID-19 and improve patients' outcomes."
Prediction of transition from mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer's disease based on a logistic regression-artificial neural network-decision tree model,other,"neural network, artificial neural network","AIM: To develop a logistic regression model, artificial neural network (ANN) model and decision tree (DT) model for the progression of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to Alzheimer's disease (AD) to compare the performance of the three models.
METHODS: A total of 425 patients with MCI were screened from the original cohort. The actual follow up included 361 patients, with AD as the outcome variable. Three kinds of prediction models were developed: a logistic regression model, ANN model and DT model. The performance of all three models was measured with accuracy, sensitivity, positive predictive value and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve.
RESULTS: A total of 121 patients with MCI developed AD, and the average conversion rate was 9.49% per year. The ANN model had higher accuracy (89.52 ± 0.36%), area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (92.08 ± 0.12), sensitivity (82.11 ± 0.42%) and positive predictive value (75.26 ± 0.86%) than the other two models. The first five important predictors of the ANN model were, in order, ADL score, age, urine AD-associated neuronal thread protein, alcohol consumption and smoking. For the DT model, they were age, activities of daily living score, family history of dementia, urine AD-associated neuronal thread protein and alcohol consumption. For the logistic regression model, they were age, sex, activities of daily living score, alcohol consumption and smoking.
CONCLUSION: The logistic regression, ANN and DT models performed well at predicting the transition from MCI to AD with ideal stability. However, the ANN model had the best predictive value. Increased age, activities of daily living score, urine AD-associated neuronal thread protein, alcohol consumption, smoking and sex were important factors. Geriatr Gerontol Int 2021; 21: 43-47."
Development and internal validation of risk prediction model of metabolic syndrome in oil workers,other,"neural network, convolutional neural network","BACKGROUND: The prevalence of metabolic syndrome continues to rise sharply worldwide, seriously threatening people's health. The optimal model can be used to identify people at high risk of metabolic syndrome as early as possible, to predict their risk, and to persuade them to change their adverse lifestyle so as to slow down and reduce the incidence of metabolic syndrome.
METHODS: Design existing circumstances research. A total of 1468 workers from an oil company who participated in occupational health physical examination from April 2017 to October 2018 were included in this study. We established the Logistic regression model, the random forest model and the convolutional neural network model, and compared the prediction performance of the models according to the F1 score, sensitivity, accuracy and other indicators of the three models.
RESULTS: The results showed that the accuracy of the three models was 82.49,95.98 and 92.03%, the sensitivity was 87.94,95.52 and 90.59%, the specificity was 74.54, 96.65 and 94.14%, the F1 score was 0.86,0.97 and 0.93, and the area under ROC curve was 0.88,0.96 and 0.92, respectively. The Brier score of the three models was 0.15, 0.08 and 0.12, Observed-expected ratio was 0.83, 0.97 and 1.13, and the Integrated Calibration Index was 0.075,0.073 and 0.074, respectively, and explained how the random forest model was used for individual disease risk score.
CONCLUSIONS: The study showed that the prediction performance of random forest model is better than other models, and the model has higher application value, which can better predict the risk of metabolic syndrome in oil workers, and provide corresponding theoretical basis for the health management of oil workers."
Consistency of variety of machine learning and statistical models in predicting clinical risks of individual patients: longitudinal cohort study using cardiovascular disease as exemplar,other,"neural network, machine learning model","OBJECTIVE: To assess the consistency of machine learning and statistical techniques in predicting individual level and population level risks of cardiovascular disease and the effects of censoring on risk predictions.
DESIGN: Longitudinal cohort study from 1 January 1998 to 31 December 2018.
SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: 3.6 million patients from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink registered at 391 general practices in England with linked hospital admission and mortality records.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Model performance including discrimination, calibration, and consistency of individual risk prediction for the same patients among models with comparable model performance. 19 different prediction techniques were applied, including 12 families of machine learning models (grid searched for best models), three Cox proportional hazards models (local fitted, QRISK3, and Framingham), three parametric survival models, and one logistic model.
RESULTS: The various models had similar population level performance (C statistics of about 0.87 and similar calibration). However, the predictions for individual risks of cardiovascular disease varied widely between and within different types of machine learning and statistical models, especially in patients with higher risks. A patient with a risk of 9.5-10.5% predicted by QRISK3 had a risk of 2.9-9.2% in a random forest and 2.4-7.2% in a neural network. The differences in predicted risks between QRISK3 and a neural network ranged between -23.2% and 0.1% (95% range). Models that ignored censoring (that is, assumed censored patients to be event free) substantially underestimated risk of cardiovascular disease. Of the 223 815 patients with a cardiovascular disease risk above 7.5% with QRISK3, 57.8% would be reclassified below 7.5% when using another model.
CONCLUSIONS: A variety of models predicted risks for the same patients very differently despite similar model performances. The logistic models and commonly used machine learning models should not be directly applied to the prediction of long term risks without considering censoring. Survival models that consider censoring and that are explainable, such as QRISK3, are preferable. The level of consistency within and between models should be routinely assessed before they are used for clinical decision making."
COVID-19 Mortality Rate Prediction for India Using Statistical Neural Network Models,other,neural network,"The primary aim of this study is to investigate suitable Statistical Neural Network (SNN) models and their hybrid version for COVID-19 mortality prediction in Indian populations and is to estimate the future COVID-19 death cases for India. SNN models such as Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN), Radial Basis Function Neural Network (RBFNN), and Generalized Regression Neural Network (GRNN) are applied to develop the COVID-19 Mortality Rate Prediction (MRP) model for India. For this purpose, we have used two datasets as D1 and D2. The performances of these models are evaluated using Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and ""R,"" a correlation value between actual and predicted value. To improve prediction accuracy, the new hybrid models have been constructed by combining SNN models and the Non-linear Autoregressive Neural Network (NAR-NN). This is to predict the future error of the SNN models, which adds to the predicted value of these models for getting better MRP value. The results showed that the PNN and RBFNN-based MRP model performed better than the other models for COVID-19 datasets D2 and D1, respectively."
"Prediction, pattern recognition and modelling of complications post-endovascular infra renal aneurysm repair by artificial intelligence",other,"neural network, artificial neural network","OBJECTIVES: The study evaluates the plausibility and applicability of prediction, pattern recognition and modelling of complications post-endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) by artificial intelligence for more accurate surveillance in practice.
METHODS: A single-centre prospective data collection on (n = 250) EVAR cases with n = 26 preoperative attributes (factors) on endpoint of endoleak (types I-VI), occlusion, migration and mortality over a 13-year period was conducted. In addition to the traditional statistical analysis, data was subjected to machine learning algorithm through artificial neural network. The predictive accuracy (specificity and -1 sensitivity) on each endpoint is presented with percentage and receiver operative curve. The pattern recognition and model classification were conducted using discriminate analysis, decision tree, logistic regression, naive Bayes and support vector machines, and the best fit model was deployed for pattern recognition and modelling.
RESULTS: The accuracy of the training, validation and predictive ability of artificial neural network in detection of endoleak type I was 95, 96 and 94%, type II (94, 83, 90 and 82%) and type III was 96, 94 and 96%, respectively. Endpoints are associated with increase in weights through predictive modeling that were not detected through statistical analytics. The overall accuracy of the model was >86%.
CONCLUSION: The study highlights the applicability, accuracy and reliability of artificial intelligence in the detection of adverse outcomes post-EVAR for an accurate surveillance stratification."
Development and validation of an artificial neural network prognostic model after gastrectomy for gastric carcinoma: An international multicenter cohort study,other,"neural network, artificial neural network, multilayer perceptron","BACKGROUND: Recently, artificial neural network (ANN) methods have also been adopted to deal with the complex multidimensional nonlinear relationship between clinicopathologic variables and survival for patients with gastric cancer. Using a multinational cohort, this study aimed to develop and validate an ANN-based survival prediction model for patients with gastric cancer.
METHODS: Patients with gastric cancer who underwent gastrectomy in a Chinese center, a Japanese center, and recorded in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database, respectively, were included in this study. Multilayer perceptron neural network was used to develop the prediction model. Time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, area under the curves (AUCs), and decision curve analysis (DCA) were used to compare the ANN model with previous prediction models.
RESULTS: An ANN model with nine input nodes, nine hidden nodes, and two output nodes was constructed. These three cohort's data showed that the AUC of the model was 0.795, 0.836, and 0.850 for 5-year survival prediction, respectively. In the calibration curve analysis, the ANN-predicted survival had a high consistency with the actual survival. Comparison of the DCA and time-dependent ROC between the ANN model and previous prediction models showed that the ANN model had good and stable prediction capability compared to the previous models in all cohorts.
CONCLUSIONS: The ANN model has significantly better discriminative capability and allows an individualized survival prediction. This model has good versatility in Eastern and Western data and has high clinical application value."
Differentiation of Cytopathic Effects (CPE) induced by influenza virus infection using deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN),other,"neural network, convolutional neural network","Cell culture remains as the golden standard for primary isolation of viruses in clinical specimens. In the current practice, researchers have to recognize the cytopathic effects (CPE) induced by virus infection and subsequently use virus-specific monoclonal antibody to confirm the presence of virus. Considering the broad applications of neural network in various fields, we aimed to utilize convolutional neural networks (CNN) to shorten the timing required for CPE identification and to improve the assay sensitivity. Based on the characteristics of influenza-induced CPE, a CNN model with larger sizes of filters and max-pooling kernels was constructed in the absence of transfer learning. A total of 601 images from mock-infected and influenza-infected MDCK cells were used to train the model. The performance of the model was tested by using extra 400 images and the percentage of correct recognition was 99.75%. To further examine the limit of our model in evaluating the changes of CPE overtime, additional 1190 images from a new experiment were used and the recognition rates at 16 hour (hr), 28 hr, and 40 hr post virus infection were 71.80%, 98.25%, and 87.46%, respectively. The specificity of our model, examined by images of MDCK cells infected by six other non-influenza viruses, was 100%. Hence, a simple CNN model was established to enhance the identification of influenza virus in clinical practice."
Forecasting the monthly incidence rate of brucellosis in west of Iran using time series and data mining from 2010 to 2019,other,"neural network, artificial neural network, multilayer perceptron","BACKGROUND: The identification of statistical models for the accurate forecast and timely determination of the outbreak of infectious diseases is very important for the healthcare system. Thus, this study was conducted to assess and compare the performance of four machine-learning methods in modeling and forecasting brucellosis time series data based on climatic parameters.
METHODS: In this cohort study, human brucellosis cases and climatic parameters were analyzed on a monthly basis for the Qazvin province-located in northwestern Iran- over a period of 9 years (2010-2018). The data were classified into two subsets of education (80%) and testing (20%). Artificial neural network methods (radial basis function and multilayer perceptron), support vector machine and random forest were fitted to each set. Performance analysis of the models were done using the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Absolute Root Error (MARE), and R2 criteria.
RESULTS: The incidence rate of the brucellosis in Qazvin province was 27.43 per 100,000 during 2010-2019. Based on our results, the values of the RMSE (0.22), MAE (0.175), MARE (0.007) criteria were smaller for the multilayer perceptron neural network than their values in the other three models. Moreover, the R2 (0.99) value was bigger in this model. Therefore, the multilayer perceptron neural network exhibited better performance in forecasting the studied data. The average wind speed and mean temperature were the most effective climatic parameters in the incidence of this disease.
CONCLUSIONS: The multilayer perceptron neural network can be used as an effective method in detecting the behavioral trend of brucellosis over time. Nevertheless, further studies focusing on the application and comparison of these methods are needed to detect the most appropriate forecast method for this disease."
Machine-Learning prediction of comorbid substance use disorders in ADHD youth using Swedish registry data,other,"neural network, recurrent neural network","BACKGROUND: Children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) have a high risk for substance use disorders (SUDs). Early identification of at-risk youth would help allocate scarce resources for prevention programs.
METHODS: Psychiatric and somatic diagnoses, family history of these disorders, measures of socioeconomic distress, and information about birth complications were obtained from the national registers in Sweden for 19,787 children with ADHD born between 1989 and 1993. We trained (a) a cross-sectional random forest (RF) model using data available by age 17 to predict SUD diagnosis between ages 18 and 19; and (b) a longitudinal recurrent neural network (RNN) model with the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architecture to predict new diagnoses at each age.
RESULTS: The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was 0.73(95%CI 0.70-0.76) for the random forest model (RF). Removing prior diagnosis from the predictors, the RF model was still able to achieve significant AUCs when predicting all SUD diagnoses (0.69, 95%CI 0.66-0.72) or new diagnoses (0.67, 95%CI: 0.64, 0.71) during age 18-19. For the model predicting new diagnoses, model calibration was good with a low Brier score of 0.086. Longitudinal LSTM model was able to predict later SUD risks at as early as 2 years age, 10 years before the earliest diagnosis. The average AUC from longitudinal models predicting new diagnoses 1, 2, 5 and 10 years in the future was 0.63.
CONCLUSIONS: Population registry data can be used to predict at-risk comorbid SUDs in individuals with ADHD. Such predictions can be made many years prior to age of the onset, and their SUD risks can be monitored using longitudinal models over years during child development. Nevertheless, more work is needed to create prediction models based on electronic health records or linked population registers that are sufficiently accurate for use in the clinic."
"Predicting death by suicide using administrative health care system data: Can recurrent neural network, one-dimensional convolutional neural network, and gradient boosted trees models improve prediction performance?",other,"neural network, machine learning model, feedforward neural network, convolutional neural network, recurrent neural network","BACKGROUND: Suicide is a leading cause of death, particularly in younger persons, and this results in tremendous years of life lost.
OBJECTIVE: To compare the performance of recurrent neural networks, one-dimensional convolutional neural networks, and gradient boosted trees, with logistic regression and feedforward neural networks.
METHODS: The modeling dataset contained 3548 persons that died by suicide and 35,480 persons that did not die by suicide between 2000 and 2016. 101 predictors were selected, and these were assembled for each of the 40 quarters (10 years) prior to the quarter of death, resulting in 4040 predictors in total for each person. Model configurations were evaluated using 10-fold cross-validation.
RESULTS: The optimal recurrent neural network model configuration (AUC: 0.8407), one-dimensional convolutional neural network configuration (AUC: 0.8419), and XGB model configuration (AUC: 0.8493) all outperformed logistic regression (AUC: 0.8179). In addition to superior discrimination, the optimal XGB model configuration also achieved superior calibration.
CONCLUSIONS: Although the models developed in this study showed promise, further research is needed to determine the performance limits of statistical and machine learning models that quantify suicide risk, and to develop prediction models optimized for implementation in clinical settings. It appears that the XGB model class is the most promising in terms of discrimination, calibration, and computational expense.
LIMITATIONS: Many important predictors are not available in administrative data and this likely places a limit on how well prediction models developed with administrative data can perform."
Prediction model of artificial neural network for the risk of hyperuricemia incorporating dietary risk factors in a Chinese adult study,other,"neural network, artificial neural network","BACKGROUND: Risk of hyperuricemia (HU) has been shown to be strongly associated with dietary factors. However, there is scarce evidence on prediction models incorporating dietary factors to estimate the risk of HU.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to develop a prediction model to predict the risk of HU in Chinese adults based on dietary information.
DESIGN: Our study was based on a cross-sectional survey, which recruited 1,488 community residents aged 18 to 60 years in Beijing from October 2010 to January 2011. The eligible participants were randomly divided into a training set (n <sub>1</sub> = 992) and a validation set (n <sub>2</sub> = 496) in the ratio of 2:1. We developed the prediction model in three stages. We first used a logistic regression model (LRM) based on the training set to select a set of dietary risk factors which were related to the risk of HU. Artificial neural network (ANN) was then used to construct the prediction model using the training set. Finally, we used receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis to assess the accuracy of the prediction model using training and validation sets.
RESULTS: In the training set, the mean age of participants with and without HU was 39.3 (standard deviation [SD]: 9.65) and 38.2 (SD: 9.38) years, respectively. Patients with HU consisted of 101 males (77.7%) and 29 females (22.3%). The LRM found that food frequency (vegetables [odds ratio (OR) = 0.73], meat [0.72], eggs [0.80], plant oil [0.78], tea [0.51], eating habits (breakfast [OR = 1.28]), and the salty cooking style (OR = 1.33) were associated with risk of HU. In the ANN analysis, we selected a three-layer back propagation neural network (BPNN) model with 14, 3, and 1 neuron in the input, hidden, and output layers, respectively, as the best prediction model. The areas under the ROC of the training and validation sets were 0.827 and 0.814, respectively. HU would occur when the incidence probability is greater than 0.128. The indicators of accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and Yuden Index suggested that the ANN model in our study is successful and valuable.
CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that the ANN model could be used to predict the risk of HU in Chinese adults. Further prospective studies are needed to improve the accuracy and to generalize the use of model."
DeepBTS: Prediction of Recurrence-free Survival of Non-small Cell Lung Cancer Using a Time-binned Deep Neural Network,other,neural network,"Accurate prediction of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) prognosis after surgery remains challenging. The Cox proportional hazard (PH) model is widely used, however, there are some limitations associated with it. In this study, we developed novel neural network models called binned time survival analysis (DeepBTS) models using 30 clinico-pathological features of surgically resected NSCLC patients (training cohort, n = 1,022; external validation cohort, n = 298). We employed the root-mean-square error (in the supervised learning model, s- DeepBTS) or negative log-likelihood (in the semi-unsupervised learning model, su-DeepBTS) as the loss function. The su-DeepBTS algorithm achieved better performance (C-index = 0.7306; AUC = 0.7677) than the other models (Cox PH: C-index = 0.7048 and AUC = 0.7390; s-DeepBTS: C-index = 0.7126 and AUC = 0.7420). The top 14 features were selected using su-DeepBTS model as a selector and could distinguish the low- and high-risk groups in the training cohort (p = 1.86 × 10-11) and validation cohort (p = 1.04 × 10-10). When trained with the optimal feature set for each model, the su-DeepBTS model could predict the prognoses of NSCLC better than the traditional model, especially in stage I patients. Follow-up studies using combined radiological, pathological imaging, and genomic data to enhance the performance of our model are ongoing."
CNN-based survival model for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma in medical imaging,other,"neural network, convolutional neural network","BACKGROUND: Cox proportional hazard model (CPH) is commonly used in clinical research for survival analysis. In quantitative medical imaging (radiomics) studies, CPH plays an important role in feature reduction and modeling. However, the underlying linear assumption of CPH model limits the prognostic performance. In this work, using transfer learning, a convolutional neural network (CNN) based survival model was built and tested on preoperative CT images of resectable Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDAC) patients.
RESULTS: The proposed CNN-based survival model outperformed the traditional CPH-based radiomics approach in terms of concordance index and index of prediction accuracy, providing a better fit for patients' survival patterns.
CONCLUSIONS: The proposed CNN-based survival model outperforms CPH-based radiomics pipeline in PDAC prognosis. This approach offers a better fit for survival patterns based on CT images and overcomes the limitations of conventional survival models."
Novel prognostication of patients with spinal and pelvic chondrosarcoma using deep survival neural networks,other,"neural network, artificial neural network","BACKGROUND: We used the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database to develop and validate deep survival neural network machine learning (ML) algorithms to predict survival following a spino-pelvic chondrosarcoma diagnosis.
METHODS: The SEER 18 registries were used to apply the Risk Estimate Distance Survival Neural Network (RED_SNN) in the model. Our model was evaluated at each time window with receiver operating characteristic curves and areas under the curves (AUCs), as was the concordance index (c-index).
RESULTS: The subjects (n = 1088) were separated into training (80%, n = 870) and test sets (20%, n = 218). The training data were randomly sorted into training and validation sets using 5-fold cross validation. The median c-index of the five validation sets was 0.84 (95% confidence interval 0.79-0.87). The median AUC of the five validation subsets was 0.84. This model was evaluated with the previously separated test set. The c-index was 0.82 and the mean AUC of the 30 different time windows was 0.85 (standard deviation 0.02). According to the estimated survival probability (by 62 months), we divided the test group into five subgroups. The survival curves of the subgroups showed statistically significant separation (p < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first to analyze population-level data using artificial neural network ML algorithms for the role and outcomes of surgical resection and radiation therapy in spino-pelvic chondrosarcoma."
Using machine learning models to improve stroke risk level classification methods of China national stroke screening,other,neural network,"BACKGROUND: With the character of high incidence, high prevalence and high mortality, stroke has brought a heavy burden to families and society in China. In 2009, the Ministry of Health of China launched the China national stroke screening and intervention program, which screens stroke and its risk factors and conducts high-risk population interventions for people aged above 40 years old all over China. In this program, stroke risk factors include hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, smoking, lack of exercise, apparently overweight and family history of stroke. People with more than two risk factors or history of stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) are considered as high-risk. However, it is impossible for this criterion to classify stroke risk levels for people with unknown values in fields of risk factors. The missing of stroke risk levels results in reduced efficiency of stroke interventions and inaccuracies in statistical results at the national level. In this paper, we use 2017 national stroke screening data to develop stroke risk classification models based on machine learning algorithms to improve the classification efficiency.
METHOD: Firstly, we construct training set and test sets and process the imbalance training set based on oversampling and undersampling method. Then, we develop logistic regression model, Naïve Bayesian model, Bayesian network model, decision tree model, neural network model, random forest model, bagged decision tree model, voting model and boosting model with decision trees to classify stroke risk levels.
RESULT: The recall of the boosting model with decision trees is the highest (99.94%), and the precision of the model based on the random forest is highest (97.33%). Using the random forest model (recall: 98.44%), the recall will be increased by about 2.8% compared with the method currently used, and several thousands more people with high risk of stroke can be identified each year.
CONCLUSION: Models developed in this paper can improve the current screening method in the way that it can avoid the impact of unknown values, and avoid unnecessary rescreening and intervention expenditures. The national stroke screening program can choose classification models according to the practice need."
New artificial intelligence prediction model using serial prothrombin time international normalized ratio measurements in atrial fibrillation patients on vitamin K antagonists: GARFIELD-AF,other,neural network,"AIMS: Most clinical risk stratification models are based on measurement at a single time-point rather than serial measurements. Artificial intelligence (AI) is able to predict one-dimensional outcomes from multi-dimensional datasets. Using data from Global Anticoagulant Registry in the Field (GARFIELD)-AF registry, a new AI model was developed for predicting clinical outcomes in atrial fibrillation (AF) patients up to 1 year based on sequential measures of prothrombin time international normalized ratio (PT-INR) within 30 days of enrolment.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Patients with newly diagnosed AF who were treated with vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) and had at least three measurements of PT-INR taken over the first 30 days after prescription were analysed. The AI model was constructed with multilayer neural network including long short-term memory and one-dimensional convolution layers. The neural network was trained using PT-INR measurements within days 0-30 after starting treatment and clinical outcomes over days 31-365 in a derivation cohort (cohorts 1-3; n = 3185). Accuracy of the AI model at predicting major bleed, stroke/systemic embolism (SE), and death was assessed in a validation cohort (cohorts 4-5; n = 1523). The model's c-statistic for predicting major bleed, stroke/SE, and all-cause death was 0.75, 0.70, and 0.61, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Using serial PT-INR values collected within 1 month after starting VKA, the new AI model performed better than time in therapeutic range at predicting clinical outcomes occurring up to 12 months thereafter. Serial PT-INR values contain important information that can be analysed by computer to help predict adverse clinical outcomes."
Development and validation of prediction models for hypertension risks in rural Chinese populations,other,"neural network, artificial neural network","BACKGROUND: Various hypertension predictive models have been developed worldwide; however, there is no existing predictive model for hypertension among Chinese rural populations.
METHODS: This is a 6-year population-based prospective cohort in rural areas of China. Data was collected in 2007-2008 (baseline survey) and 2013-2014 (follow-up survey) from 8319 participants ranging in age from 35 to 74 years old. Specified gender hypertension predictive models were established based on multivariate Cox regression, Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Naive Bayes Classifier (NBC), and Classification and Regression Tree (CART) in the training set. External validation was conducted in the testing set. The estimated models were assessed by discrimination and calibration, respectively.
RESULTS: During the follow-up period, 432 men and 604 women developed hypertension in the training set. Assessment for established models in men suggested men office-based model (M1) was better than others. C-index of M1 model in the testing set was 0.771 (95% confidence Interval (CI) = 0.750, 0.791), and calibration χ2 = 6.3057 (P = 0.7090). In women, women office-based model (W1) and ANN were better than the other models assessed. The C-indexes for the W1 model and the ANN model in the testing set were 0.765 (95% CI = 0.746, 0.783) and 0.756 (95% CI = 0.737, 0.775) and the calibrations χ2 were 6.7832 (P = 0.1478) and 4.7447 (P = 0.3145), respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Not all machine-learning models performed better than the traditional Cox regression models. The W1 and ANN models for women and M1 model for men have better predictive performance which could potentially be recommended for predicting hypertension risk among rural populations."
Application of three statistical models for predicting the risk of diabetes,other,neural network,"BACKGROUND: At present, the proportion of undiagnosed diabetes in Chinese adults is as high as 15.5%. People with diabetes who are not treated and controlled in time may have various complications, such as cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases and diabetic foot disorders, which not only seriously affect the quality of life of people with diabetes but also impose a heavy burden on families and society. Therefore, prevention and control of type 2 diabetes is of great significance.
METHODS: We constructed a logistic regression model, a neural network model and a decision tree model to analyse the risk factors for type 2 diabetes and then compared the prediction accuracy of the different models by calculating the area under the relative operating characteristic (ROC) curve and back-inputting the data into the model.
RESULTS: The prevalence of type 2 diabetes in 4177 subjects who were not diagnosed with type 2 diabetes was 9.31%. The most influential factors associated with type 2 diabetes were triglyceride (TG) ≥ 1.17 mmol/L (odds ratio (OR) =2.233), age ≥ 70 years (OR = 1.734), hypertension (OR = 1.703), alcohol consumption (OR = 1.674), and total cholesterol≥5.2 mmol/L (TC) (OR = 1.463). The prediction accuracies of the three prediction models were 90.8, 91.2, and 90.7%, respectively, and the areas under curve (AUCs) were 0.711, 0.780, and 0.698, respectively. The differences in the AUCs after back propagation (BP) of the neural network model, logistic regression model and decision tree model were statistically significant (P < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: BP neural networks have a higher predictive power for identifying the associated risk factors of type 2 diabetes than the other two models, but it is necessary to select a suitable model for specific situations."
Attention-based recurrent neural network for influenza epidemic prediction,other,neural network,"BACKGROUND: Influenza is an infectious respiratory disease that can cause serious public health hazard. Due to its huge threat to the society, precise real-time forecasting of influenza outbreaks is of great value to our public.
RESULTS: In this paper, we propose a new deep neural network structure that forecasts a real-time influenza-like illness rate (ILI%) in Guangzhou, China. Long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks is applied to precisely forecast accurateness due to the long-term attribute and diversity of influenza epidemic data. We devise a multi-channel LSTM neural network that can draw multiple information from different types of inputs. We also add attention mechanism to improve forecasting accuracy. By using this structure, we are able to deal with relationships between multiple inputs more appropriately. Our model fully consider the information in the data set, targetedly solving practical problems of the Guangzhou influenza epidemic forecasting.
CONCLUSION: We assess the performance of our model by comparing it with different neural network structures and other state-of-the-art methods. The experimental results indicate that our model has strong competitiveness and can provide effective real-time influenza epidemic forecasting."
Statistical spatial-temporal modeling of ambient ozone exposure for environmental epidemiology studies: A review,other,"neural network, artificial neural network","BACKGROUND: Studies have discovered the adverse health impacts of ambient ozone. Most epidemiological studies explore the relationship between ambient ozone and health effects based on fixed site monitoring data. Fine modeling of ground-level ozone exposure conducted by statistical models has great advantages for improving exposure accuracy and reducing exposure bias. However, there is no review summarizing such studies.
OBJECTIVES: A review is presented to summarize the basic process of model development and to provide some suggestions for researchers.
METHODS: A search of PubMed, Web of Science and the Wanfang Database was performed for dates through July 1, 2019 to obtain relevant studies worldwide. We also examined the references of the articles of interest to ensure that as many articles as possible were included.
RESULTS: The land use regression model (LUR model), random forest model and artificial neural network model have been used in this field. We summarized these studies in terms of model selection, data preparation, simulation scale selection, and model establishment and validation. Multiparameters are a major feature of models. Parameters that influence the formation of ground-level ozone concentrations and parameters that have been extremely important in previous articles should be considered first. The process of model establishment and validation is essentially a process of continuously optimizing the model performance, but there are certain differences in the specific models.
CONCLUSION: This review summarized the basic process of the statistical model for ambient ozone exposure. We gave the applicable conditions and application scope of different models and summarized the advantages and disadvantages of various models in ozone modeling research. In the future, research is still needed to explore this area based on its own research purposes and capabilities."
"Recurrent Neural Networks for Early Detection of Heart Failure From Longitudinal Electronic Health Record Data: Implications for Temporal Modeling With Respect to Time Before Diagnosis, Data Density, Data Quantity, and Data Type",other,"neural network, machine learning model, recurrent neural network","BACKGROUND: We determined the impact of data volume and diversity and training conditions on recurrent neural network methods compared with traditional machine learning methods.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Using longitudinal electronic health record data, we assessed the relative performance of machine learning models trained to detect a future diagnosis of heart failure in primary care patients. Model performance was assessed in relation to data parameters defined by the combination of different data domains (data diversity), the number of patient records in the training data set (data quantity), the number of encounters per patient (data density), the prediction window length, and the observation window length (ie, the time period before the prediction window that is the source of features for prediction). Data on 4370 incident heart failure cases and 30 132 group-matched controls were used. Recurrent neural network model performance was superior under a variety of conditions that included (1) when data were less diverse (eg, a single data domain like medication or vital signs) given the same training size; (2) as data quantity increased; (3) as density increased; (4) as the observation window length increased; and (5) as the prediction window length decreased. When all data domains were used, the performance of recurrent neural network models increased in relation to the quantity of data used (ie, up to 100% of the data). When data are sparse (ie, fewer features or low dimension), model performance is lower, but a much smaller training set size is required to achieve optimal performance compared with conditions where data are more diverse and includes more features.
CONCLUSIONS: Recurrent neural networks are effective for predicting a future diagnosis of heart failure given sufficient training set size. Model performance appears to continue to improve in direct relation to training set size."
Early Warning Models to Estimate the 30-Day Mortality Risk After Stent Placement for Patients with Malignant Biliary Obstruction,other,"neural network, artificial neural network","PURPOSE: To develop, validate, and compare early warning models of the 30-day mortality risk for patients with malignant biliary obstruction (MBO) undergoing percutaneous transhepatic biliary stent placement (PTBS).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between January 2013 and October 2018, this multicenter retrospective study included 299 patients with MBOs who underwent PTBS. The training set consisted of 166 patients from four cohorts, and another two independent cohorts were allocated as external validation sets A and B with 75 patients and 58 patients, respectively. A logistic model and an artificial neural network (ANN) model were developed to predict the risk of 30-day mortality after PTBS. The predictive performance of these two models was validated internally and externally.
RESULTS: The ANN model had higher values of area under the curve than the logistic model in the training set (0.819 vs 0.797), especially in the validation sets A (0.802 vs 0.714) and B (0.732 vs 0.568). Both models had high accuracy in the three sets (75.9-83.1%). Along with a high specificity, the ANN model improved the sensitivity. The net reclassification improvement and integrated discrimination improvement also demonstrated that the ANN model led to improvements in predictive ability compared with the logistic model.
CONCLUSIONS: Early warning models were proposed to predict the risk of 30-day mortality after PTBS in patients with MBO. The ANN model has higher accuracy and better generalizability than the logistic model."
Predicting death by suicide using administrative health care system data: Can feedforward neural network models improve upon logistic regression models?,other,"neural network, machine learning model, feedforward neural network","BACKGROUND: Suicide is a leading cause of death worldwide. With the increasing volume of administrative health care data, there is an opportunity to evaluate whether machine learning models can improve upon statistical models for quantifying suicide risk.
OBJECTIVE: To compare the relative performance of logistic regression and single hidden layer feedforward neural network models that quantify suicide risk with predictors available in administrative health care system data.
METHODS: The modeling dataset contained 3548 persons that died by suicide and 35,480 persons that did not die by suicide between 2000 and 2016. 101 predictors were selected, and these were assembled for each of the 40 quarters (10 years) prior to the quarter of death, resulting in 4040 predictors in total for each person. Logistic regression and single hidden layer feedforward neural network model configurations were evaluated using 10-fold cross-validation.
RESULTS: The optimal feedforward neural network model configuration (AUC: 0.8352) outperformed logistic regression (AUC: 0.8179).
LIMITATIONS: Many important predictors are not available in administrative data and this likely places a limit on how well prediction models developed with administrative data can perform.
CONCLUSIONS: Although the models developed in this study showed promise, further research is needed to determine the performance limits of statistical and machine learning models that quantify suicide risk, and to develop prediction models optimized for implementation in clinical settings."
Prediction of the length of service at the onset of coal workers' pneumoconiosis based on neural network,other,neural network,"Three environmental parameters, i.e. dust concentrations, dust dispersion, and free silica content, were introduced into the traditional indices of the neural network model in order to construct a new prediction index and explore a new method for preventing the incidence of pneumoconiosis with intelligent accuracy and universality. Data of the pneumoconiosis patients from Huabei Mining Group (HBMG) of China from 1980 to 2017 were collected. SPSS22.0 was used to develop the combined models based on Back Propagation (BP) neural network model, Radial Basis Function (RBF) neural network model, and Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) model. The paired sample t-test was performed between the real and predicted values. According to this model, it was predicted that 382 coal workers in HBMG were likely to suffer from pneumoconiosis in 2022 and the incidence rate was 4.48%. It is necessary to take prevention measures and transfer these workers from their current positions. In four combined models, the BP-MLR combined model achieved the optimal error parameters and the most accurate prediction. This study provided a scientific basis for effective control and prevention of the incidence of the pneumoconiosis."
Comparison of autoregressive integrated moving average model and generalised regression neural network model for prediction of haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome in China: a time-series study,other,neural network,"OBJECTIVES: Haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) is a serious threat to public health in China, accounting for almost 90% cases reported globally. Infectious disease prediction may help in disease prevention despite some uncontrollable influence factors. This study conducted a comparison between a hybrid model and two single models in forecasting the monthly incidence of HFRS in China.
DESIGN: Time-series study.
SETTING: The People's Republic of China.
METHODS: Autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model, generalised regression neural network (GRNN) model and hybrid ARIMA-GRNN model were constructed by R V.3.4.3 software. The monthly reported incidence of HFRS from January 2011 to May 2018 were adopted to evaluate models' performance. Root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) were adopted to evaluate these models' effectiveness. Spatial stratified heterogeneity of the time series was tested by month and another GRNN model was built with a new series.
RESULTS: The monthly incidence of HFRS in the past several years showed a slight downtrend and obvious seasonal variation. A total of four plausible ARIMA models were built and ARIMA(2,1,1) (2,1,1)<sub>12</sub> model was selected as the optimal model in HFRS fitting. The smooth factors of the basic GRNN model and the hybrid model were 0.027 and 0.043, respectively. The single ARIMA model was the best in fitting part (MAPE=9.1154, MAE=89.0302, RMSE=138.8356) while the hybrid model was the best in prediction (MAPE=17.8335, MAE=152.3013, RMSE=196.4682). GRNN model was revised by building model with new series and the forecasting performance of revised model (MAPE=17.6095, MAE=163.8000, RMSE=169.4751) was better than original GRNN model (MAPE=19.2029, MAE=177.0356, RMSE=202.1684).
CONCLUSIONS: The hybrid ARIMA-GRNN model was better than single ARIMA and basic GRNN model in forecasting monthly incidence of HFRS in China. It could be considered as a decision-making tool in HFRS prevention and control."
Application of a hybrid model in predicting the incidence of tuberculosis in a Chinese population,other,neural network,"Objective: To investigate suitable forecasting models for tuberculosis (TB) in a Chinese population by comparing the predictive value of the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model and the ARIMA-generalized regression neural network (GRNN) hybrid model. Methods: We used the monthly incidence rate of TB in Lianyungang city from January 2007 through June 2016 to construct a fitting model, and we used the incidence rate from July 2016 to December 2016 to evaluate the forecasting accuracy. The root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), mean absolute error (MAE) and mean error rate (MER) were used to assess the performance of these models in fitting and forecasting the incidence of TB. Results: The ARIMA (10, 1, 0) (0, 1, 1)<sub>12</sub> model was selected from plausible ARIMA models, and the optimal spread value of the ARIMA-GRNN hybrid model was 0.23. For the fitting dataset, the RMSE, MAPE, MAE and MER were 0.5594, 11.5000, 0.4202 and 0.1132, respectively, for the ARIMA (10, 1, 0) (0, 1, 1)<sub>12</sub> model, and 0.5259, 11.2181, 0.3992 and 0.1075, respectively, for the ARIMA-GRNN hybrid model. For the forecasting dataset, the RMSE, MAPE, MAE and MER were 0.2805, 8.8797, 0.2261 and 0.0851, respectively, for the ARIMA (10, 1, 0) (0, 1, 1)<sub>12</sub> model, and 0.2553, 5.7222, 0.1519 and 0.0571, respectively, for the ARIMA-GRNN hybrid model. Conclusions: The ARIMA-GRNN hybrid model was shown to be superior to the single ARIMA model in predicting the short-term TB incidence in the Chinese population, especially in fitting and forecasting the peak and trough incidence."
Time series analysis of human brucellosis in mainland China by using Elman and Jordan recurrent neural networks,other,"neural network, recurrent neural network","BACKGROUND: Establishing epidemiological models and conducting predictions seems to be useful for the prevention and control of human brucellosis. Autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models can capture the long-term trends and the periodic variations in time series. However, these models cannot handle the nonlinear trends correctly. Recurrent neural networks can address problems that involve nonlinear time series data. In this study, we intended to build prediction models for human brucellosis in mainland China with Elman and Jordan neural networks. The fitting and forecasting accuracy of the neural networks were compared with a traditional seasonal ARIMA model.
METHODS: The reported human brucellosis cases were obtained from the website of the National Health and Family Planning Commission of China. The human brucellosis cases from January 2004 to December 2017 were assembled as monthly counts. The training set observed from January 2004 to December 2016 was used to build the seasonal ARIMA model, Elman and Jordan neural networks. The test set from January 2017 to December 2017 was used to test the forecast results. The root mean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) were used to assess the fitting and forecasting accuracy of the three models.
RESULTS: There were 52,868 cases of human brucellosis in Mainland China from January 2004 to December 2017. We observed a long-term upward trend and seasonal variance in the original time series. In the training set, the RMSE and MAE of Elman and Jordan neural networks were lower than those in the ARIMA model, whereas the MAPE of Elman and Jordan neural networks was slightly higher than that in the ARIMA model. In the test set, the RMSE, MAE and MAPE of Elman and Jordan neural networks were far lower than those in the ARIMA model.
CONCLUSIONS: The Elman and Jordan recurrent neural networks achieved much higher forecasting accuracy. These models are more suitable for forecasting nonlinear time series data, such as human brucellosis than the traditional ARIMA model."
Predicting in-hospital mortality of patients with acute kidney injury in the ICU using random forest model,other,"neural network, artificial neural network, machine learning model","OBJECTIVES: We aimed to construct a mortality prediction model using the random forest (RF) algorithm for acute kidney injury (AKI) patients in the intensive care unit (ICU), and compared its performance with that of two other machine learning models and the customized simplified acute physiology score (SAPS) II model.
METHODS: We used medical information mart for intensive care (MIMIC) III database for model development and performance comparison. The RF model uses the same predictor variable set as that of the SAPS II model. We also developed three other models and compared the RF model with the other three models in prediction performance. Three other models include support vector machine (SVM) model, artificial neural network (ANN) model and customized SAPS II model. In model comparison, the prediction performance of each model was assessed by the Brier score, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), accuracy and F<sub>1</sub> score.
RESULTS: The final cohort consisted of 19044 patients with AKI in the ICU. The observed in-hospital mortality of AKI patients is 13.6% in the final cohort. The results of model performance comparison show that the Brier score of the RF model is 0.085 (95%CI: 0.084-0.086) and AUROC of the RF model is 0.866 (95%CI: 0.862-0.870). The accuracy of the RF model is 0.728 (95%CI: 0.715-0.741). The F<sub>1</sub> score of the RF model is 0.459 (95%CI: 0.449-0.470). The calibration plots show that the RF model slightly overestimates mortality in patients with low risk of death and underestimates mortality in patients with high risk of death.
CONCLUSION: There is great potential for the RF model in mortality prediction for AKI patients in ICU. The RF model may be helpful to aid ICU clinicians to make timely clinical intervention decisions for AKI patients, which is critical to help reduce the in-hospital mortality of AKI patients. A prospective study is necessary to evaluate the clinical utility of the RF model."
Opening the black box of neural networks: methods for interpreting neural network models in clinical applications,other,"neural network, artificial neural network, feedforward neural network","Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are powerful tools for data analysis and are particularly suitable for modeling relationships between variables for best prediction of an outcome. While these models can be used to answer many important research questions, their utility has been critically limited because the interpretation of the ""black box"" model is difficult. Clinical investigators usually employ ANN models to predict the clinical outcomes or to make a diagnosis; the model however is difficult to interpret for clinicians. To address this important shortcoming of neural network modeling methods, we describe several methods to help subject-matter audiences (e.g., clinicians, medical policy makers) understand neural network models. Garson's algorithm describes the relative magnitude of the importance of a descriptor (predictor) in its connection with outcome variables by dissecting the model weights. The Lek's profile method explores the relationship of the outcome variable and a predictor of interest, while holding other predictors at constant values (e.g., minimum, 20th quartile, maximum). While Lek's profile was developed specifically for neural networks, partial dependence plot is a more generic version that visualize the relationship between an outcome and one or two predictors. Finally, the local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME) method can show the predictions of any classification or regression, by approximating it locally with an interpretable model. R code for the implementations of these methods is shown by using example data fitted with a standard, feed-forward neural network model. We offer codes and step-by-step description on how to use these tools to facilitate better understanding of ANN."
Research on Improved Depth Belief Network-Based Prediction of Cardiovascular Diseases,other,neural network,"Quantitative analysis and prediction can help to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease. Quantitative prediction based on traditional model has low accuracy. The variance of model prediction based on shallow neural network is larger. In this paper, cardiovascular disease prediction model based on improved deep belief network (DBN) is proposed. Using the reconstruction error, the network depth is determined independently, and unsupervised training and supervised optimization are combined. It ensures the accuracy of model prediction while guaranteeing stability. Thirty experiments were performed independently on the Statlog (Heart) and Heart Disease Database data sets in the UCI database. Experimental results showed that the mean of prediction accuracy was 91.26% and 89.78%, respectively. The variance of prediction accuracy was 5.78 and 4.46, respectively."
Evaluation of machine learning algorithms for improved risk assessment for Down's syndrome,other,neural network,"Prenatal screening generates a great amount of data that is used for predicting risk of various disorders. Prenatal risk assessment is based on multiple clinical variables and overall performance is defined by how well the risk algorithm is optimized for the population in question. This article evaluates machine learning algorithms to improve performance of first trimester screening of Down syndrome. Machine learning algorithms pose an adaptive alternative to develop better risk assessment models using the existing clinical variables. Two real-world data sets were used to experiment with multiple classification algorithms. Implemented models were tested with a third, real-world, data set and performance was compared to a predicate method, a commercial risk assessment software. Best performing deep neural network model gave an area under the curve of 0.96 and detection rate of 78% with 1% false positive rate with the test data. Support vector machine model gave area under the curve of 0.95 and detection rate of 61% with 1% false positive rate with the same test data. When compared with the predicate method, the best support vector machine model was slightly inferior, but an optimized deep neural network model was able to give higher detection rates with same false positive rate or similar detection rate but with markedly lower false positive rate. This finding could further improve the first trimester screening for Down syndrome, by using existing clinical variables and a large training data derived from a specific population."
Time-series analysis of tuberculosis from 2005 to 2017 in China,other,neural network,"Seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) has been used to model nationwide tuberculosis (TB) incidence in other countries. This study aimed to characterise monthly TB notification rate in China. Monthly TB notification rate from 2005 to 2017 was used. Time-series analysis was based on a SARIMA model and a hybrid model of SARIMA-generalised regression neural network (GRNN) model. A decreasing trend (3.17% per years, P < 0.01) and seasonal variation of TB notification rate were found from 2005 to 2016 in China, with a predominant peak in spring. A SARIMA model of ARIMA (0,1,1) (0,1,1)12 was identified. The mean error rate of the single SARIMA model and the SARIMA-GRNN combination model was 6.07% and 2.56%, and the determination coefficient was 0.73 and 0.94, respectively. The better performance of the SARIMA-GRNN combination model was further confirmed with the forecasting dataset (2017). TB is a seasonal disease in China, with a predominant peak in spring, and the trend of TB decreased by 3.17% per year. The SARIMA-GRNN model was more effective than the widely used SARIMA model at predicting TB incidence."
Predicting the Survival of Gastric Cancer Patients Using Artificial and Bayesian Neural Networks,other,"neural network, artificial neural network","Introduction and purpose: In recent years the use of neural networks without any premises for investigation of prognosis in analyzing survival data has increased. Artificial neural networks (ANN) use small processors with a continuous network to solve problems inspired by the human brain. Bayesian neural networks (BNN) constitute a neural-based approach to modeling and non-linearization of complex issues using special algorithms and statistical methods. Gastric cancer incidence is the first and third ranking for men and women in Iran, respectively. The aim of the present study was to assess the value of an artificial neural network and a Bayesian neural network for modeling and predicting of probability of gastric cancer patient death. Materials and Methods: In this study, we used information on 339 patients aged from 20 to 90 years old with positive gastric cancer, referred to Afzalipoor and Shahid Bahonar Hospitals in Kerman City from 2001 to 2015. The three layers perceptron neural network (ANN) and the Bayesian neural network (BNN) were used for predicting the probability of mortality using the available data. To investigate differences between the models, sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and the area under receiver operating characteristic curves (AUROCs) were generated. Results: In this study, the sensitivity and specificity of the artificial neural network and Bayesian neural network models were 0.882, 0.903 and 0.954, 0.909, respectively. Prediction accuracy and the area under curve ROC for the two models were 0.891, 0.944 and 0.935, 0.961. The age at diagnosis of gastric cancer was most important for predicting survival, followed by tumor grade, morphology, gender, smoking history, opium consumption, receiving chemotherapy, presence of metastasis, tumor stage, receiving radiotherapy, and being resident in a village. Conclusion: The findings of the present study indicated that the Bayesian neural network is preferable to an artificial neural network for predicting survival of gastric cancer patients in Iran."
Anthropometric Measures and Frailty Prediction in the Elderly: An Easy-to-Use Tool,other,"neural network, artificial neural network","PURPOSE: Anthropometry is a useful tool for assessing some risk factors for frailty. Thus, the aim of this study was to verify the discriminatory performance of anthropometric measures in identifying frailty in the elderly and to create an easy-to-use tool.
METHODS: Cross-sectional study: a subset from the Multidimensional Study of the Elderly in the Family Health Strategy (EMI-SUS) evaluating 538 older adults. Individuals were classified using the Fried Phenotype criteria, and 26 anthropometric measures were obtained. The predictive ability of anthropometric measures in identifying frailty was identified through logistic regression and an artificial neural network. The accuracy of the final models was assessed with an ROC curve.
RESULTS: The final model comprised the following predictors: weight, waist circumference, bicipital skinfold, sagittal abdominal diameter, and age. The final neural network models presented a higher ROC curve of 0.78 (CI 95% 0.74-0.82) (P &lt; 0.001) than the logistic regression model, with an ROC curve of 0.71 (CI 95% 0.66-0.77) (P &lt; 0.001).
CONCLUSION: The neural network model provides a reliable tool for identifying prefrailty/frailty in the elderly, with the advantage of being easy to apply in the primary health care. It may help to provide timely interventions to ameliorate the risk of adverse events."
Forecasting influenza-like illness dynamics for military populations using neural networks and social media,other,"neural network, machine learning model, recurrent neural network","This work is the first to take advantage of recurrent neural networks to predict influenza-like illness (ILI) dynamics from various linguistic signals extracted from social media data. Unlike other approaches that rely on timeseries analysis of historical ILI data and the state-of-the-art machine learning models, we build and evaluate the predictive power of neural network architectures based on Long Short Term Memory (LSTMs) units capable of nowcasting (predicting in ""real-time"") and forecasting (predicting the future) ILI dynamics in the 2011 - 2014 influenza seasons. To build our models we integrate information people post in social media e.g., topics, embeddings, word ngrams, stylistic patterns, and communication behavior using hashtags and mentions. We then quantitatively evaluate the predictive power of different social media signals and contrast the performance of the-state-of-the-art regression models with neural networks using a diverse set of evaluation metrics. Finally, we combine ILI and social media signals to build a joint neural network model for ILI dynamics prediction. Unlike the majority of the existing work, we specifically focus on developing models for local rather than national ILI surveillance, specifically for military rather than general populations in 26 U.S. and six international locations., and analyze how model performance depends on the amount of social media data available per location. Our approach demonstrates several advantages: (a) Neural network architectures that rely on LSTM units trained on social media data yield the best performance compared to previously used regression models. (b) Previously under-explored language and communication behavior features are more predictive of ILI dynamics than stylistic and topic signals expressed in social media. (c) Neural network models learned exclusively from social media signals yield comparable or better performance to the models learned from ILI historical data, thus, signals from social media can be potentially used to accurately forecast ILI dynamics for the regions where ILI historical data is not available. (d) Neural network models learned from combined ILI and social media signals significantly outperform models that rely solely on ILI historical data, which adds to a great potential of alternative public sources for ILI dynamics prediction. (e) Location-specific models outperform previously used location-independent models e.g., U.S. only. (f) Prediction results significantly vary across geolocations depending on the amount of social media data available and ILI activity patterns. (g) Model performance improves with more tweets available per geo-location e.g., the error gets lower and the Pearson score gets higher for locations with more tweets."
Prediction of 5-year overall survival in cervical cancer patients treated with radical hysterectomy using computational intelligence methods,other,"neural network, multilayer perceptron","BACKGROUND: Computational intelligence methods, including non-linear classification algorithms, can be used in medical research and practice as a decision making tool. This study aimed to evaluate the usefulness of artificial intelligence models for 5-year overall survival prediction in patients with cervical cancer treated by radical hysterectomy.
METHODS: The data set was collected from 102 patients with cervical cancer FIGO stage IA2-IIB, that underwent primary surgical treatment. Twenty-three demographic, tumor-related parameters and selected perioperative data of each patient were collected. The simulations involved six computational intelligence methods: the probabilistic neural network (PNN), multilayer perceptron network, gene expression programming classifier, support vector machines algorithm, radial basis function neural network and k-Means algorithm. The prediction ability of the models was determined based on the accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, as well as the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. The results of the computational intelligence methods were compared with the results of linear regression analysis as a reference model.
RESULTS: The best results were obtained by the PNN model. This neural network provided very high prediction ability with an accuracy of 0.892 and sensitivity of 0.975. The area under the receiver operating characteristics curve of PNN was also high, 0.818. The outcomes obtained by other classifiers were markedly worse.
CONCLUSIONS: The PNN model is an effective tool for predicting 5-year overall survival in cervical cancer patients treated with radical hysterectomy."
Risk-adjusted colorectal cancer screening using the FIT and routine screening data: development of a risk prediction model,other,"neural network, feedforward neural network","BACKGROUND: The faecal immunochemical test (FIT) is replacing the guaiac faecal occult blood test in colorectal cancer screening. Increased uptake and FIT positivity will challenge colonoscopy services. We developed a risk prediction model combining routine screening data with FIT concentration to improve the accuracy of screening referrals.
METHODS: Multivariate analysis used complete cases of those with a positive FIT (⩾20 μg g-1) and diagnostic outcome (n=1810; 549 cancers and advanced adenomas). Logistic regression was used to develop a risk prediction model using the FIT result and screening data: age, sex and previous screening history. The model was developed further using a feedforward neural network. Model performance was assessed by discrimination and calibration, and test accuracy was investigated using clinical sensitivity, specificity and receiver operating characteristic curves.
RESULTS: Discrimination improved from 0.628 with just FIT to 0.659 with the risk-adjusted model (P=0.01). Calibration using the Hosmer-Lemeshow test was 0.90 for the risk-adjusted model. The sensitivity improved from 30.78% to 33.15% at similar specificity (FIT threshold of 160 μg g-1). The neural network further improved model performance and test accuracy.
CONCLUSIONS: Combining routinely available risk predictors with the FIT improves the clinical sensitivity of the FIT with an increase in the diagnostic yield of high-risk adenomas."
Design and application of tumor prediction model based on statistical method<sup/>,other,neural network,"Two prediction models for tumor prediction based on logistic regression and BP neural network were proposed in this paper; a sensitivity analysis of risk factors was also conducted. The two protocols will be implemented in the R language and demonstrated with relevant lung cancer data. Additionally, the two models are compared, verifying their accuracy and feasibility. Finally, a function is combined with R language, which can quickly achieve the above two programs. It is set up to obtain the tumor prediction model and the risk factors on the degree of correlation of the size of the disease. This method is convenient and practical and we hope it can be applied in the early discovery of cancer during future medicine."
"A New Hybrid Model Using an Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average and a Generalized Regression Neural Network for the Incidence of Tuberculosis in Heng County, China",other,neural network,"It is a daunting task to eradicate tuberculosis completely in Heng County due to a large transient population, human immunodeficiency virus/tuberculosis coinfection, and latent infection. Thus, a high-precision forecasting model can be used for the prevention and control of tuberculosis. In this study, four models including a basic autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model, a traditional ARIMA-generalized regression neural network (GRNN) model, a basic GRNN model, and a new ARIMA-GRNN hybrid model were used to fit and predict the incidence of tuberculosis. Parameters including mean absolute error (MAE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), and mean square error (MSE) were used to evaluate and compare the performance of these models for fitting historical and prospective data. The new ARIMA-GRNN model had superior fit relative to both the traditional ARIMA-GRNN model and basic ARIMA model when applied to historical data and when used as a predictive model for forecasting incidence during the subsequent 6 months. Our results suggest that the new ARIMA-GRNN model may be more suitable for forecasting the tuberculosis incidence in Heng County than traditional models."
"Construction and evaluation of two computational models for predicting the incidence of influenza in Nagasaki Prefecture, Japan",other,neural network,"It remains challenging to forecast local, seasonal outbreaks of influenza. The goal of this study was to construct a computational model for predicting influenza incidence. We built two computational models including an Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) model and a hybrid model integrating ARDL with a Generalized Regression Neural Network (GRNN), to assess meteorological factors associated with temporal trends in influenza incidence. The modelling and forecasting performance of these two models were compared using observations collected between 2006 and 2015 in Nagasaki Prefecture, Japan. In both the training and forecasting stages, the hybrid model showed lower error rates, including a lower residual mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) than the ARDL model. The lag of log-incidence, weekly average barometric pressure, and weekly average of air temperature were 4, 1, and 3, respectively in the ARDL model. The ARDL-GRNN hybrid model can serve as a tool to better understand the characteristics of influenza epidemic, and facilitate their prevention and control."
Hybrid methodology for tuberculosis incidence time-series forecasting based on ARIMA and a NAR neural network,other,neural network,"Tuberculosis (TB) affects people globally and is being reconsidered as a serious public health problem in China. Reliable forecasting is useful for the prevention and control of TB. This study proposes a hybrid model combining autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) with a nonlinear autoregressive (NAR) neural network for forecasting the incidence of TB from January 2007 to March 2016. Prediction performance was compared between the hybrid model and the ARIMA model. The best-fit hybrid model was combined with an ARIMA (3,1,0) × (0,1,1)12 and NAR neural network with four delays and 12 neurons in the hidden layer. The ARIMA-NAR hybrid model, which exhibited lower mean square error, mean absolute error, and mean absolute percentage error of 0·2209, 0·1373, and 0·0406, respectively, in the modelling performance, could produce more accurate forecasting of TB incidence compared to the ARIMA model. This study shows that developing and applying the ARIMA-NAR hybrid model is an effective method to fit the linear and nonlinear patterns of time-series data, and this model could be helpful in the prevention and control of TB."
A clinical decision support system for prediction of pregnancy outcome in pregnant women with systemic lupus erythematosus,other,"neural network, artificial neural network, multilayer perceptron","OBJECTIVE: Pregnancy among systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)-affected women is highly associated with poor obstetric outcomes. Predicting the risk of foetal outcome is essential for maximizing the success of pregnancy. This study aimed to develop a clinical decision support system (CDSS) to predict pregnancy outcomes among SLE-affected pregnant women.
METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of 149 pregnant women with SLE, who were followed at Shariati Hospital (104 pregnancies) and a specialized clinic (45 pregnancies) from 1982 to 2014. We selected significant features (p<0.10) using a binary logistic regression model performed in IBM SPSS (version 20). Afterward, we trained several artificial neural networks (multi-layer perceptron [MLP] and radial basis function [RBF]) to predict the pregnancy outcome. In order to evaluate and select the most effective network, we used the confusion matrix and the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. We finally developed a CDSS based on the most accurate network. MATLAB 2013b software was applied to design the neural networks and develop the CDSS.
RESULTS: Initially, 45 potential variables were analysed by the binary logistic regression and 16 effective features were selected as the inputs of neural networks (P-value<0.1). The accuracy (90.9%), sensitivity (80.0%), and specificity (94.1%) of the test data for the MLP network were achieved. These measures for the RBF network were 71.4%, 53.3%, and 79.4%, respectively. Having applied a 10-fold cross-validation method, the accuracy for the networks showed 75.16% accuracy for RBF and 90.6% accuracy for MLP. Therefore, the MLP network was selected as the most accurate network for prediction of pregnancy outcome.
CONCLUSION: The developed CDSS based on the MLP network can help physicians to predict pregnancy outcomes in women with SLE."
Application of artificial neural network model combined with four biomarkers in auxiliary diagnosis of lung cancer,other,"neural network, artificial neural network","The purpose of the study was to explore the application of artificial neural network model in the auxiliary diagnosis of lung cancer and compare the effects of back-propagation (BP) neural network with Fisher discrimination model for lung cancer screening by the combined detections of four biomarkers of p16, RASSF1A and FHIT gene promoter methylation levels and the relative telomere length. Real-time quantitative methylation-specific PCR was used to detect the levels of three-gene promoter methylation, and real-time PCR method was applied to determine the relative telomere length. BP neural network and Fisher discrimination analysis were used to establish the discrimination diagnosis model. The levels of three-gene promoter methylation in patients with lung cancer were significantly higher than those of the normal controls. The values of Z(P) in two groups were 2.641 (0.008), 2.075 (0.038) and 3.044 (0.002), respectively. The relative telomere lengths of patients with lung cancer (0.93 ± 0.32) were significantly lower than those of the normal controls (1.16 ± 0.57), t = 4.072, P < 0.001. The areas under the ROC curve (AUC) and 95 % CI of prediction set from Fisher discrimination analysis and BP neural network were 0.670 (0.569-0.761) and 0.760 (0.664-0.840). The AUC of BP neural network was higher than that of Fisher discrimination analysis, and Z(P) was 0.76. Four biomarkers are associated with lung cancer. BP neural network model for the prediction of lung cancer is better than Fisher discrimination analysis, and it can provide an excellent and intelligent diagnosis tool for lung cancer."
Prediction of Clinical Deterioration in Hospitalized Adult Patients with Hematologic Malignancies Using a Neural Network Model,other,neural network,"INTRODUCTION: Clinical deterioration (ICU transfer and cardiac arrest) occurs during approximately 5-10% of hospital admissions. Existing prediction models have a high false positive rate, leading to multiple false alarms and alarm fatigue. We used routine vital signs and laboratory values obtained from the electronic medical record (EMR) along with a machine learning algorithm called a neural network to develop a prediction model that would increase the predictive accuracy and decrease false alarm rates.
DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study.
SETTING: The hematologic malignancy unit in an academic medical center in the United States.
PATIENT POPULATION: Adult patients admitted to the hematologic malignancy unit from 2009 to 2010.
INTERVENTION: None.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Vital signs and laboratory values were obtained from the electronic medical record system and then used as predictors (features). A neural network was used to build a model to predict clinical deterioration events (ICU transfer and cardiac arrest). The performance of the neural network model was compared to the VitalPac Early Warning Score (ViEWS). Five hundred sixty five consecutive total admissions were available with 43 admissions resulting in clinical deterioration. Using simulation, the neural network outperformed the ViEWS model with a positive predictive value of 82% compared to 24%, respectively.
CONCLUSION: We developed and tested a neural network-based prediction model for clinical deterioration in patients hospitalized in the hematologic malignancy unit. Our neural network model outperformed an existing model, substantially increasing the positive predictive value, allowing the clinician to be confident in the alarm raised. This system can be readily implemented in a real-time fashion in existing EMR systems."
[Prediction of schistosomiasis infection rates of population based on ARIMA-NARNN model],other,neural network,"OBJECTIVE: To explore the effect of the autoregressive integrated moving average model-nonlinear auto-regressive neural network (ARIMA-NARNN) model on predicting schistosomiasis infection rates of population.
METHODS: The ARIMA model, NARNN model and ARIMA-NARNN model were established based on monthly schistosomiasis infection rates from January 2005 to February 2015 in Jiangsu Province, China. The fitting and prediction performances of the three models were compared.
RESULTS: Compared to the ARIMA model and NARNN model, the mean square error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of the ARIMA-NARNN model were the least with the values of 0.011 1, 0.090 0 and 0.282 4, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: The ARIMA-NARNN model could effectively fit and predict schistosomiasis infection rates of population, which might have a great application value for the prevention and control of schistosomiasis."
Prospective Assessment of a Symptomatic Cerebral Vasospasm Predictive Neural Network Model,other,neural network,"INTRODUCTION: The author introduced a symptomatic cerebral vasospasm (SCV) prediction model built with freeware based on a 91-patient dataset. In a prospective test group of 22 patients at the same hospital, this model outperformed logistic regression models in vasospasm prediction on the basis of the same datasets. One of the model's limitations was a question of reproducibility in other centers. In this report, the author describes his experience with the prospective use of the model at a different hospital with a different population setting.
METHODS: Patient data of 25 consecutive cases of aneurysm rupture were prospectively assessed by the model to predict SCV. The prediction was then compared with actual outcome. For the purpose of this report, SCV is defined as a delayed focal decline in neurological examination correlated with an area of radiographic vasospasm. This serves as the primary end point of the predictive model. Each case prediction is reported, along with strength of prediction, which is built into the model. The model's positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and sensitivity and specificity are reported.
RESULTS: Twenty-five patients are included in the analysis. Six patients (24%) were diagnosed with SCV. The model predicted 9 patients would have SCV (positive predictive value 67%). The model predicted 16 patients would not have SCV (negative predictive value 100%). The sensitivity of the model was 100%, and the specificity of the model was 84%.
DISCUSSION: The present analysis displays the predictive value of a neural network to model symptomatic cerebral vasospasm."
"Application of a Combined Model with Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) and Generalized Regression Neural Network (GRNN) in Forecasting Hepatitis Incidence in Heng County, China",other,neural network,"BACKGROUND: Hepatitis is a serious public health problem with increasing cases and property damage in Heng County. It is necessary to develop a model to predict the hepatitis epidemic that could be useful for preventing this disease.
METHODS: The autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model and the generalized regression neural network (GRNN) model were used to fit the incidence data from the Heng County CDC (Center for Disease Control and Prevention) from January 2005 to December 2012. Then, the ARIMA-GRNN hybrid model was developed. The incidence data from January 2013 to December 2013 were used to validate the models. Several parameters, including mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and mean square error (MSE), were used to compare the performance among the three models.
RESULTS: The morbidity of hepatitis from Jan 2005 to Dec 2012 has seasonal variation and slightly rising trend. The ARIMA(0,1,2)(1,1,1)12 model was the most appropriate one with the residual test showing a white noise sequence. The smoothing factor of the basic GRNN model and the combined model was 1.8 and 0.07, respectively. The four parameters of the hybrid model were lower than those of the two single models in the validation. The parameters values of the GRNN model were the lowest in the fitting of the three models.
CONCLUSIONS: The hybrid ARIMA-GRNN model showed better hepatitis incidence forecasting in Heng County than the single ARIMA model and the basic GRNN model. It is a potential decision-supportive tool for controlling hepatitis in Heng County."

Usage of Probabilistic and General Regression Neural Network for Early Detection and Prevention of Oral Cancer,other,neural network,"In India, the oral cancers are usually presented in advanced stage of malignancy. It is critical to ascertain the diagnosis in order to initiate most advantageous treatment of the suspicious lesions. The main hurdle in appropriate treatment and control of oral cancer is identification and risk assessment of early disease in the community in a cost-effective fashion. The objective of this research is to design a data mining model using probabilistic neural network and general regression neural network (PNN/GRNN) for early detection and prevention of oral malignancy. The model is built using the oral cancer database which has 35 attributes and 1025 records. All the attributes pertaining to clinical symptoms and history are considered to classify malignant and non-malignant cases. Subsequently, the model attempts to predict particular type of cancer, its stage and extent with the help of attributes pertaining to symptoms, gross examination and investigations. Also, the model envisages anticipating the survivability of a patient on the basis of treatment and follow-up details. Finally, the performance of the PNN/GRNN model is compared with that of other classification models. The classification accuracy of PNN/GRNN model is 80% and hence is better for early detection and prevention of the oral cancer."
Use of an Artificial Neural Network to Construct a Model of Predicting Deep Fungal Infection in Lung Cancer Patients,other,"neural network, artificial neural network","BACKGROUND: The statistical methods to analyze and predict the related dangerous factors of deep fungal infection in lung cancer patients were several, such as logic regression analysis, meta-analysis, multivariate Cox proportional hazards model analysis, retrospective analysis, and so on, but the results are inconsistent.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 696 patients with lung cancer were enrolled. The factors were compared employing Student's t-test or the Mann-Whitney test or the Chi-square test and variables that were significantly related to the presence of deep fungal infection selected as candidates for input into the final artificial neural network analysis (ANN) model. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and area under curve (AUC) were used to evaluate the performance of the artificial neural network (ANN) model and logistic regression (LR) model.
RESULTS: The prevalence of deep fungal infection from lung cancer in this entire study population was 32.04%(223/696), deep fungal infections occur in sputum specimens 44.05% (200/454). The ratio of candida albicans was 86.99% (194/223) in the total fungi. It was demonstrated that older (≥65 years), use of antibiotics, low serum albumin concentrations (≤37.18 g /L), radiotherapy, surgery, low hemoglobin hyperlipidemia (≤93.67 g /L), long time of hospitalization (≥14 days) were apt to deep fungal infection and the ANN model consisted of the seven factors. The AUC of ANN model (0.829±0.019) was higher than that of LR model (0.756±0.021).
CONCLUSIONS: The artificial neural network model with variables consisting of age, use of antibiotics, serum albumin concentrations, received radiotherapy, received surgery, hemoglobin, time of hospitalization should be useful for predicting the deep fungal infection in lung cancer."
The application of data mining techniques to oral cancer prognosis,other,"neural network, artificial neural network","This study adopted an integrated procedure that combines the clustering and classification features of data mining technology to determine the differences between the symptoms shown in past cases where patients died from or survived oral cancer. Two data mining tools, namely decision tree and artificial neural network, were used to analyze the historical cases of oral cancer, and their performance was compared with that of logistic regression, the popular statistical analysis tool. Both decision tree and artificial neural network models showed superiority to the traditional statistical model. However, as to clinician, the trees created by the decision tree models are relatively easier to interpret compared to that of the artificial neural network models. Cluster analysis also discovers that those stage 4 patients whose also possess the following four characteristics are having an extremely low survival rate: pN is N2b, level of RLNM is level I-III, AJCC-T is T4, and cells mutate situation (G) is moderate."
Predicting outcomes in patients with perforated gastroduodenal ulcers: artificial neural network modelling indicates a highly complex disease,other,"neural network, artificial neural network","PURPOSE: Mortality prediction models for patients with perforated peptic ulcer (PPU) have not yielded consistent or highly accurate results. Given the complex nature of this disease, which has many non-linear associations with outcomes, we explored artificial neural networks (ANNs) to predict the complex interactions between the risk factors of PPU and death among patients with this condition.
METHODS: ANN modelling using a standard feed-forward, back-propagation neural network with three layers (i.e., an input layer, a hidden layer and an output layer) was used to predict the 30-day mortality of consecutive patients from a population-based cohort undergoing surgery for PPU. A receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to assess model accuracy.
RESULTS: Of the 172 patients, 168 had their data included in the model; the data of 117 (70%) were used for the training set, and the data of 51 (39%) were used for the test set. The accuracy, as evaluated by area under the ROC curve (AUC), was best for an inclusive, multifactorial ANN model (AUC 0.90, 95% CIs 0.85-0.95; p < 0.001). This model outperformed standard predictive scores, including Boey and PULP. The importance of each variable decreased as the number of factors included in the ANN model increased.
CONCLUSIONS: The prediction of death was most accurate when using an ANN model with several univariate influences on the outcome. This finding demonstrates that PPU is a highly complex disease for which clinical prognoses are likely difficult. The incorporation of computerised learning systems might enhance clinical judgments to improve decision making and outcome prediction."
"A novel hybrid classification model of genetic algorithms, modified k-Nearest Neighbor and developed backpropagation neural network",other,"neural network, artificial neural network","Among numerous artificial intelligence approaches, k-Nearest Neighbor algorithms, genetic algorithms, and artificial neural networks are considered as the most common and effective methods in classification problems in numerous studies. In the present study, the results of the implementation of a novel hybrid feature selection-classification model using the above mentioned methods are presented. The purpose is benefitting from the synergies obtained from combining these technologies for the development of classification models. Such a combination creates an opportunity to invest in the strength of each algorithm, and is an approach to make up for their deficiencies. To develop proposed model, with the aim of obtaining the best array of features, first, feature ranking techniques such as the Fisher's discriminant ratio and class separability criteria were used to prioritize features. Second, the obtained results that included arrays of the top-ranked features were used as the initial population of a genetic algorithm to produce optimum arrays of features. Third, using a modified k-Nearest Neighbor method as well as an improved method of backpropagation neural networks, the classification process was advanced based on optimum arrays of the features selected by genetic algorithms. The performance of the proposed model was compared with thirteen well-known classification models based on seven datasets. Furthermore, the statistical analysis was performed using the Friedman test followed by post-hoc tests. The experimental findings indicated that the novel proposed hybrid model resulted in significantly better classification performance compared with all 13 classification methods. Finally, the performance results of the proposed model was benchmarked against the best ones reported as the state-of-the-art classifiers in terms of classification accuracy for the same data sets. The substantial findings of the comprehensive comparative study revealed that performance of the proposed model in terms of classification accuracy is desirable, promising, and competitive to the existing state-of-the-art classification models."
Bayesian neural network approach for determining the risk of re-intervention after endovascular aortic aneurysm repair,other,neural network,"This article proposes a Bayesian neural network approach to determine the risk of re-intervention after endovascular aortic aneurysm repair surgery. The target of proposed technique is to determine which patients have high chance to re-intervention (high-risk patients) and which are not (low-risk patients) after 5 years of the surgery. Two censored datasets relating to the clinical conditions of aortic aneurysms have been collected from two different vascular centers in the United Kingdom. A Bayesian network was first employed to solve the censoring issue in the datasets. Then, a back propagation neural network model was built using the uncensored data of the first center to predict re-intervention on the second center and classify the patients into high-risk and low-risk groups. Kaplan-Meier curves were plotted for each group of patients separately to show whether there is a significant difference between the two risk groups. Finally, the logrank test was applied to determine whether the neural network model was capable of predicting and distinguishing between the two risk groups. The results show that the Bayesian network used for uncensoring the data has improved the performance of the neural networks that were built for the two centers separately. More importantly, the neural network that was trained with uncensored data of the first center was able to predict and discriminate between groups of low risk and high risk of re-intervention after 5 years of endovascular aortic aneurysm surgery at center 2 (p = 0.0037 in the logrank test)."
Prediction of survival of ICU patients using computational intelligence,other,neural network,"This paper presents a computational-intelligence-based model to predict the survival rate of critically ill patients who were admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU). The prediction input variables were based on the first 24 h admission physiological data of ICU patients to forecast whether the final outcome was survival or not. The prediction model was based on a particle swarm optimization (PSO)-based Fuzzy Hyper-Rectangular Composite Neural Network (PFHRCNN) that integrates three computational intelligence tools including hyper-rectangular composite neural networks, fuzzy systems and PSO. It could help doctors to make appropriate treatment decisions without excessive laboratory tests. The performance of the proposed prediction model was evaluated on the data set collected from 300 ICU patients in the Cathy General Hospital in 2012. There were 10 input variables in total for the prediction model. Nine of these variables (e.g. systolic arterial blood pressures, systolic non-invasive blood pressures, respiratory rate, heart rate, and body temperature) were routinely available for 24 h in ICU and the last variable is patient's age. The proposed model could achieve a 96% and 86% accuracy rate for the training data and testing data, respectively."
"Application of a hybrid model for predicting the incidence of tuberculosis in Hubei, China",other,neural network,"BACKGROUND: A prediction model for tuberculosis incidence is needed in China which may be used as a decision-supportive tool for planning health interventions and allocating health resources.
METHODS: The autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model was first constructed with the data of tuberculosis report rate in Hubei Province from Jan 2004 to Dec 2011.The data from Jan 2012 to Jun 2012 were used to validate the model. Then the generalized regression neural network (GRNN)-ARIMA combination model was established based on the constructed ARIMA model. Finally, the fitting and prediction accuracy of the two models was evaluated.
RESULTS: A total of 465,960 cases were reported between Jan 2004 and Dec 2011 in Hubei Province. The report rate of tuberculosis was highest in 2005 (119.932 per 100,000 population) and lowest in 2010 (84.724 per 100,000 population). The time series of tuberculosis report rate show a gradual secular decline and a striking seasonal variation. The ARIMA (2, 1, 0) × (0, 1, 1)12 model was selected from several plausible ARIMA models. The residual mean square error of the GRNN-ARIMA model and ARIMA model were 0.4467 and 0.6521 in training part, and 0.0958 and 0.1133 in validation part, respectively. The mean absolute error and mean absolute percentage error of the hybrid model were also less than the ARIMA model.
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: The gradual decline in tuberculosis report rate may be attributed to the effect of intensive measures on tuberculosis. The striking seasonal variation may have resulted from several factors. We suppose that a delay in the surveillance system may also have contributed to the variation. According to the fitting and prediction accuracy, the hybrid model outperforms the traditional ARIMA model, which may facilitate the allocation of health resources in China."

A hybrid seasonal prediction model for tuberculosis incidence in China,other,neural network,"BACKGROUND: Tuberculosis (TB) is a serious public health issue in developing countries. Early prediction of TB epidemic is very important for its control and intervention. We aimed to develop an appropriate model for predicting TB epidemics and analyze its seasonality in China.
METHODS: Data of monthly TB incidence cases from January 2005 to December 2011 were obtained from the Ministry of Health, China. A seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) model and a hybrid model which combined the SARIMA model and a generalized regression neural network model were used to fit the data from 2005 to 2010. Simulation performance parameters of mean square error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) were used to compare the goodness-of-fit between these two models. Data from 2011 TB incidence data was used to validate the chosen model.
RESULTS: Although both two models could reasonably forecast the incidence of TB, the hybrid model demonstrated better goodness-of-fit than the SARIMA model. For the hybrid model, the MSE, MAE and MAPE were 38969150, 3406.593 and 0.030, respectively. For the SARIMA model, the corresponding figures were 161835310, 8781.971 and 0.076, respectively. The seasonal trend of TB incidence is predicted to have lower monthly incidence in January and February and higher incidence from March to June.
CONCLUSIONS: The hybrid model showed better TB incidence forecasting than the SARIMA model. There is an obvious seasonal trend of TB incidence in China that differed from other countries."
In-hospital mortality after traumatic brain injury surgery: a nationwide population-based comparison of mortality predictors used in artificial neural network and logistic regression models,other,"neural network, artificial neural network","OBJECT: Most reports compare artificial neural network (ANN) models and logistic regression models in only a single data set, and the essential issue of internal validity (reproducibility) of the models has not been adequately addressed. This study proposes to validate the use of the ANN model for predicting in-hospital mortality after traumatic brain injury (TBI) surgery and to compare the predictive accuracy of ANN with that of the logistic regression model.
METHODS: The authors of this study retrospectively analyzed 16,956 patients with TBI nationwide who were surgically treated in Taiwan between 1998 and 2009. For every 1000 pairs of ANN and logistic regression models, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), Hosmer-Lemeshow statistics, and accuracy rate were calculated and compared using paired t-tests. A global sensitivity analysis was also performed to assess the relative importance of input parameters in the ANN model and to rank the variables in order of importance.
RESULTS: The ANN model outperformed the logistic regression model in terms of accuracy in 95.15% of cases, in terms of Hosmer-Lemeshow statistics in 43.68% of cases, and in terms of the AUC in 89.14% of cases. The global sensitivity analysis of in-hospital mortality also showed that the most influential (sensitive) parameters in the ANN model were surgeon volume followed by hospital volume, Charlson comorbidity index score, length of stay, sex, and age.
CONCLUSIONS: This work supports the continued use of ANNs for predictive modeling of neurosurgery outcomes. However, further studies are needed to confirm the clinical efficacy of the proposed model."

Comparison of logistic regression and artificial neural network in low back pain prediction: second national health survey,other,"neural network, artificial neural network","BACKGROUND: The purpose of this investigation was to compare empirically predictive ability of an artificial neural network with a logistic regression in prediction of low back pain.
METHODS: Data from the second national health survey were considered in this investigation. This data includes the information of low back pain and its associated risk factors among Iranian people aged 15 years and older. Artificial neural network and logistic regression models were developed using a set of 17294 data and they were validated in a test set of 17295 data. Hosmer and Lemeshow recommendation for model selection was used in fitting the logistic regression. A three-layer perceptron with 9 inputs, 3 hidden and 1 output neurons was employed. The efficiency of two models was compared by receiver operating characteristic analysis, root mean square and -2 Loglikelihood criteria.
RESULTS: The area under the ROC curve (SE), root mean square and -2Loglikelihood of the logistic regression was 0.752 (0.004), 0.3832 and 14769.2, respectively. The area under the ROC curve (SE), root mean square and -2Loglikelihood of the artificial neural network was 0.754 (0.004), 0.3770 and 14757.6, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Based on these three criteria, artificial neural network would give better performance than logistic regression. Although, the difference is statistically significant, it does not seem to be clinically significant."
Artificial neural network model for predicting 5-year mortality after surgery for hepatocellular carcinoma: a nationwide study,other,"neural network, artificial neural network","BACKGROUND: To validate the use of artificial neural network (ANN) models for predicting 5-year mortality in HCC and to compare their predictive capability with that of logistic regression (LR) models.
METHODS: This study retrospectively compared LR and ANN models based on initial clinical data for 22,926 HCC surgery patients from 1998 to 2009. A global sensitivity analysis was also performed to assess the relative significance of input parameters in the system model and to rank the importance of variables.
RESULTS: Compared to the LR models, the ANN models had a better accuracy rate in 96.57 % of cases, a better Hosmer-Lemeshow statistic in 0.34 of cases, and a better receiver operating characteristic curves in 88.51 % of cases. Surgeon volume was the most influential (sensitive) parameter affecting 5-year mortality followed by hospital volume and Charlson co-morbidity index.
CONCLUSIONS: In comparison with the conventional LR model, the ANN model in this study was more accurate in predicting 5-year mortality. Further studies of this model may consider the effect of a more detailed database that includes complications and clinical examination findings as well as more detailed outcome data."
Predicting three-year kidney graft survival in recipients with systemic lupus erythematosus,other,"neural network, artificial neural network","Predicting the outcome of kidney transplantation is important in optimizing transplantation parameters and modifying factors related to the recipient, donor, and transplant procedure. As patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) secondary to lupus nephropathy are generally younger than the typical ESRD patients and also seem to have inferior transplant outcome, developing an outcome prediction model in this patient category has high clinical relevance. The goal of this study was to compare methods of building prediction models of kidney transplant outcome that potentially can be useful for clinical decision support. We applied three well-known data mining methods (classification trees, logistic regression, and artificial neural networks) to the data describing recipients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in the US Renal Data System (USRDS) database. The 95% confidence interval (CI) of the area under the receiver-operator characteristic curves (AUC) was used to measure the discrimination ability of the prediction models. Two groups of predictors were selected to build the prediction models. Using input variables based on Weka (a open source machine learning software) supplemented with additional variables of known clinical relevance (38 total predictors), the logistic regression performed the best overall (AUC: 0.74, 95% CI: 0.72-0.77)-significantly better (p < 0.05) than the classification trees (AUC: 0.70, 95% CI: 0.67-0.72) but not significantly better (p = 0.218) than the artificial neural networks (AUC: 0.71, 95% CI: 0.69-0.73). The performance of the artificial neural networks was not significantly better than that of the classification trees (p = 0.693). Using the more parsimonious subset of variables (six variables), the logistic regression (AUC: 0.73, 95% CI: 0.71-0.75) did not perform significantly better than either the classification tree (AUC: 0.70, 95% CI: 0.68-0.73) or the artificial neural network (AUC: 0.73, 95% CI: 0.70-0.75) models. We generated several models predicting 3-year allograft survival in kidney transplant recipients with SLE that potentially can be used in practice. The performance of logistic regression and classification tree was not inferior to more complex artificial neural network. Prediction models may be used in clinical practice to identify patients at risk."

METHODS: The epidemiological survey data of 8914 community residents was selected and divided into a trained group (6686 cases) and a test group (2228 cases). Artificial neural network (ANN) and Logistic regression analysis were used to establish prediction models, and then the results were evaluated by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve.
RESULTS: The specificity (64.79%) of AAN model forecasting the results of test group was lower, but the sensitivity (94.86%), Youden's index (59.65%) and consistency rate (81.23%) of AAN model was higher than the Logistic regression predicted model (specificity = 77.49%, sensitivity = 53.51%, Youden' s index = 31.00% and consistency rate = 81.23%, respectively). Moreover, the area under ROC curve of ANN prediction model (Az = 0.824 +/- 0.009) was significantly bigger than the Logistic regression prediction model (Az = 0. 655 +/- 0.012).
CONCLUSION: The discrimination performance of ANN model is better than Logistic regression in the prediction of health risk of dyslipidemia in individuals."

Neural network analysis to predict mortality in end-stage renal disease: application to United States Renal Data System,other,neural network,"We examined whether we could develop models based on data provided to the United States Renal Data System (USRDS) to accurately predict survival. Records were obtained from patients beginning dialysis in 1990 through 2007. We developed linear and neural network models and optimized the fit of these models to the actual time to death. Next, we examined whether we could accurately predict survival in a dataset containing censored and uncensored patients. The results with these models were contrasted with those obtained with a Cox proportional hazards model fit to the entire dataset. The average C statistic over a 6-month to 10-year time range achieved with these models was approximately 0.7891 (linear model), 0.7804 (transformed dataset linear model), 0.7769 (neural network model), 0.7774 (transformed dataset neural network model), 0.8019 (Cox model), and 0.7970 (transformed dataset Cox model). When we used the Cox proportional hazards model, superior C statistic results were found at time points between 2 and 10 years but at earlier time points, the Cox model was slightly inferior. These results suggest that data provided to the USRDS can allow for predictive models which have a high degree of accuracy years following the initiation of dialysis."
[Comparison of predictive effect between the single auto regressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model and the ARIMA-generalized regression neural network (GRNN) combination model on the incidence of scarlet fever],other,neural network,"Application of the 'single auto regressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model' and the 'ARIMA-generalized regression neural network (GRNN) combination model' in the research of the incidence of scarlet fever. Establish the auto regressive integrated moving average model based on the data of the monthly incidence on scarlet fever of one city, from 2000 to 2006. The fitting values of the ARIMA model was used as input of the GRNN, and the actual values were used as output of the GRNN. After training the GRNN, the effect of the single ARIMA model and the ARIMA-GRNN combination model was then compared.

The fitting efficacy of the ARIMA-GRNN combination model was better than the single ARIMA, which had practical value in the research on time series data such as the incidence of scarlet fever."
Comparison of hospital charge prediction models for gastric cancer patients: neural network vs. decision tree models,other,"neural network, artificial neural network","BACKGROUND: In recent years, artificial neural network is advocated in modeling complex multivariable relationships due to its ability of fault tolerance; while decision tree of data mining technique was recommended because of its richness of classification arithmetic rules and appeal of visibility. The aim of our research was to compare the performance of ANN and decision tree models in predicting hospital charges on gastric cancer patients.
METHODS: Data about hospital charges on 1008 gastric cancer patients and related demographic information were collected from the First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University from 2005 to 2007 and preprocessed firstly to select pertinent input variables. Then artificial neural network (ANN) and decision tree models, using same hospital charge output variable and same input variables, were applied to compare the predictive abilities in terms of mean absolute errors and linear correlation coefficients for the training and test datasets. The transfer function in ANN model was sigmoid with 1 hidden layer and three hidden nodes.
RESULTS: After preprocess of the data, 12 variables were selected and used as input variables in two types of models. For both the training dataset and the test dataset, mean absolute errors of ANN model were lower than those of decision tree model (1819.197 vs. 2782.423, 1162.279 vs. 3424.608) and linear correlation coefficients of the former model were higher than those of the latter (0.955 vs. 0.866, 0.987 vs. 0.806).

Artificial neural network versus multiple logistic function to predict 25-year coronary heart disease mortality in the Seven Countries Study,other,"neural network, multilayer perceptron","AIMS AND METHODS: We investigated 12 763 men enrolled in the Seven Countries Study and 25-year coronary heart disease (CHD) mortality to compare the predictive discrimination of the multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural network versus multiple logistic function based on four standard, continuous risk factors, selected a priori. The patients were grouped according to geographical distribution, which also parallels CHD mortality risk. Logistic model solutions were estimated for each geographic area. Training neural network models were estimated in one high risk (US) and one low risk (Italy) population and each was rerun in each nonindex population.
RESULTS: CHD mortality prediction by training MLP neural network or multiple logistic function had similar (0.669-0.699) receiver operating characteristic area under the curve (AUC). The rerun of MLP neural network models derived from the US and Italy yielded comparable AUC similar to the logistic solutions in Northern and Eastern Europe, but higher AUC in two areas [0.633 (logistic) vs. 0.665 or 0.666 (neural network: P<0.05) in Southern Europe and 0.676 (logistic) vs. 0.725 or 0.737 (neural network: P<0.01) in Japan].
CONCLUSION: This is the first investigation performed on epidemiological data to suggest a good performance in predicting long-term CHD mortality, on the basis of few continuous risk factors, of a training neural network model that could be rerun on different populations with satisfactory findings."
Analysis of survival data having time-dependent covariates,other,neural network,"Cox's proportional hazards model has been widely used for the analysis of treatment and prognostic effects with censored survival data. In this paper, we propose a neural network model based on bootstrapping to estimate the survival function and predict the short-term survival at any time during the course of the disease. The bootstrapping for the neural network is introduced when selecting the optimum number of hidden units and testing the goodness-of-fit. The proposed methods are illustrated using data from a long-term study of patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC)."
[The application of artificial neural network in studying landless farmer's mental health problems],other,"neural network, artificial neural network","To introduce a method of classification with high precision--the artificial neural network (ANN), and to compare the results using logistic regression method. Using data from 1070 landless peasants' mental health survey, the artificial neural network models and logistic regression model were built and compared on their advantages and disadvantages of the two models. The prediction accuracy for artificial neural network was 94.229% and for logistic regression it was 51.028%. ANN appeared to have had good ability on generalization. ANN displayed advantages when conditions of classical statistical techniques could not be met or the predictive effect appeared to be unsatisfactory. Hence, ANN would make a better fracture of its application in medical research."
Assessment of gastric cancer survival: using an artificial hierarchical neural network,other,neural network,"This study is designed to assess the application of neural networks in comparison to the Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazards model in the survival analysis. Three hundred thirty gastric cancer patients admitted to and surgically treated were assessed and their post-surgical survival was determined. The observed baseline survival was determined with the three methods of Kaplan-Meier product limit estimator, Cox and the neural network and results were compared. Then the binary independent variables were entered into the model. Data were randomly divided into two groups of 165 each to test the models and assess the reproducibility. The Chi-square test and the multiple logistic model were used to ensure the groups were similar and the data was divided randomly. To compare subgroups, we used the log-rank test. In the next step, the probability of survival in different periods was computed based on the training group data using the Cox proportional hazards and a neural network and estimating Cox coefficient values and neural network weights (with 3 nodes in hidden layer). Results were used for predictions in the test group data and these predictions were compared using the Kaplan-Meier product limit estimator as the gold standard. Friedman and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used for comparisons as well. All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 11.5, Matlab version 7.2, Statistica version 6.0 and S_PLUS 2000. The significance level was considered 5% (alpha = 0.05). The three methods used showed no significance difference in base survival probabilities. Overall, there was no significant difference among the survival probabilities or the trend of changes in survival probabilities calculated with the three methods, but the 4 year (48th month) and 4.5 year (54th month) survival rates were significantly different with Cox compared to standard and estimated probabilities in the neural network (p < 0.05). Kaplan-Meier and Cox showed almost similar results for the baseline survival probabilities, but results with the neural network were different: higher probabilities up to the 4th year, then comparable with the other two methods. Estimates from Cox proportional hazards and the neural network with three nodes in hidden layer were compared with the estimate from the Kaplan-Meier estimator as the gold standard. Neither comparison showed statistically significant differences. The standard error ratio of the two estimate groups by Cox and the neural network to Kaplan-Meier were no significant differences, it indicated that the neural network was more accurate. Although we do not suggest neural network methods to estimate the baseline survival probability, it seems these models is more accurately estimated as compared with the Cox proportional hazards, especially with today's advanced computer sciences that allow complex calculations. These methods are preferable because they lack the limitations of conventional models and obviate the need for unnecessary assumptions including those related to the proportionality of hazards and linearity."
[Introduction on a forecasting model for infectious disease incidence rate based on radial basis function network],other,neural network,"It is important to forecast incidence rates of infectious disease for the development of a better program on its prevention and control. Since the incidence rate of infectious disease is influenced by multiple factors, and the action mechanisms of these factors are usually unable to be described with accurate mathematical linguistic forms, the radial basis function (RBF) neural network is introduced to solve the nonlinear approximation issues and to predict incidence rates of infectious disease. The forecasting model is constructed under data from hepatitis B monthly incidence rate reports from 1991-2002. After learning and training on the basic concepts of the network, simulation experiments are completed, and then the incidence rates from Jan. 2003-Jun. 2003 forecasted by the established model. Through comparing with the actual incidence rate, the reliability of the model is evaluated. When comparing with ARIMA model, RBF network model seems to be more effective and feasible for predicting the incidence rates of infectious disease, observed in the short term."
Time-to-event analysis with artificial neural networks: an integrated analytical and rule-based study for breast cancer,other,"neural network, artificial neural network","This paper presents an analysis of censored survival data for breast cancer specific mortality and disease-free survival. There are three stages to the process, namely time-to-event modelling, risk stratification by predicted outcome and model interpretation using rule extraction. Model selection was carried out using the benchmark linear model, Cox regression but risk staging was derived with Cox regression and with Partial Logistic Regression Artificial Neural Networks regularised with Automatic Relevance Determination (PLANN-ARD). This analysis compares the two approaches showing the benefit of using the neural network framework especially for patients at high risk. The neural network model also has results in a smooth model of the hazard without the need for limiting assumptions of proportionality. The model predictions were verified using out-of-sample testing with the mortality model also compared with two other prognostic models called TNG and the NPI rule model. Further verification was carried out by comparing marginal estimates of the predicted and actual cumulative hazards. It was also observed that doctors seem to treat mortality and disease-free models as equivalent, so a further analysis was performed to observe if this was the case. The analysis was extended with automatic rule generation using Orthogonal Search Rule Extraction (OSRE). This methodology translates analytical risk scores into the language of the clinical domain, enabling direct validation of the operation of the Cox or neural network model. This paper extends the existing OSRE methodology to data sets that include continuous-valued variables."
Continuous and discrete time survival analysis: neural network approaches,other,neural network,"In this paper we describe and compare two neural network models aimed at survival analysis modeling, based on formulations in continuous and discrete time. Learning in both models is approached in a Bayesian inference framework. We test the models on a real survival analysis problem, and we show that both models exhibit good discrimination and calibration capabilities. The C index of discrimination varied from 0.8 (SE=0.093) at year 1, to 0.75 (SE=0.034) at year 7 for the continuous time model; from 0.81 (SE=0.07) at year 1, to 0.75 (SE=0.033) at year 7 for the discrete time model. For both models the calibration was good (p<0.05) up to 7 years."
[Determining the risk factors of uterine myomas by using back propagation neural network],other,"neural network, artificial neural network","OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the value of a back propagation (BP) network in determining the risk factors of uterine myomas.
METHODS: Using stratified randomized sampling method, 1260 women were surveyed by questionnaire. 1:2 matched case-control study was conducted in 113 cases of uterine myomas. Neural network tools box of Software MATLAB 6.5 was used to train and simulate BP artificial network. The mean impact value (MIV) for each input variables was analyzed, and was compared with multiple logistic regression analysis and log-linear model for interaction between factors.

Artificial neural network versus subjective scoring in predicting mortality in trauma patients,other,"neural network, multilayer perceptron","OBJECTIVE: Current methods of trauma outcome prediction rely on clinical knowledge and experience. This makes the system a subjective score, because of intra-rater variability. This project aims to develop a neural network for predicting survival of trauma patients using standard, measured, physiological variables, and compare its predictive power with that obtained from current trauma scores.
METHODS: The project uses 7688 patients admitted to the Swedish Medical Center, Colorado, U.S.A. between the years 2000-2003 inclusive. Neural Network software was used for data analysis to determine the best network design on which to base the model to be tested. The model is created using a minimum number of variables to produce an effective outcome predicting score. Initial variables were based on the current variables used in calculating the Revised Trauma Score, replacing the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) with a modified motor component of the GCS. Additional variables are added to the model until a suitable model is achieved.
RESULTS: The best model used Multi-Layer Perceptrons, with 8 input variables, 5 hidden neurons and 1 output. It was trained on 5881 cases and tested independently on 1807 cases. The model was able to accurately predict 91% patient mortality.
CONCLUSIONS: An ANN developed using pre-hospital physiological variables without using subjective scores resulted in good mortality prediction when applied to a test set. Its performance was too sensitive and requires refinement."
Prediction of significant fibrosis in hepatitis C virus infected liver transplant recipients by artificial neural network analysis of clinical factors,other,"neural network, artificial neural network","OBJECTIVES: Interest in developing noninvasive markers of liver fibrosis continues to increase, especially in recurrent hepatitis C virus infection after liver transplantation. Recently, a model for predicting significant fibrosis (bridging fibrosis and cirrhosis) on the basis of logistic regression and routine laboratory data has been proposed (logit model). The aim of the present study was to evaluate the accuracy of an artificial neural network, a technique reported to work better than logit models in complex biological situations, built on those same clinical variables and data set of patients, in predicting significant fibrosis.
METHODS: The neural network was constructed on the training set of 414 protocol biopsies, from liver transplant recipients, and then tested on the remaining 96 biopsies, as validation set. Model performances of neural network and logit model were evaluated and compared by means of areas under receiver operating characteristic curves.
RESULTS: With a cutoff value of >0.4 to predict significant fibrosis, the neural network provided sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, respectively, of 100, 79.5, 60.5 and 100%, in the validation set. The performance of the neural network was significantly better than that of the logit model (in the validation set area under the curve = 0.93 vs. 0.84; P = 0.045).
CONCLUSIONS: Artificial neural network provides accurate prediction of the presence or absence of significant fibrosis from clinical variables, allowing theoretically protocol liver biopsy to be avoided in several instances, a result of particular interest, given the lack of other types of reliable noninvasive indexes of fibrosis in the setting of transplantation."
A neural network model for combining clinical predictors of antidepressant response in mood disorders,other,"neural network, artificial neural network","Artificial neural networks (ANN) represent a promising tool for combining multiple predictors in complex diseases. Antidepressant response in mood disorders is a typical complex phenomenon were a number of predictors influence outcome under non-linear interactions. In the present study we tested a neural network strategy for antidepressant outcome in subjects affected by major depression. One hundred and forty-five never reported depressed inpatients were included in this study (major depressives/bipolars: 111/34). A multi layer perceptron network composed of 1 hidden layer with 13 nodes was chosen. The network was performed on the sample of 145 cases divided as follows: train 73+verify 36+test 36. Correlation of predicted versus observed response was 0.46 in the test (independent) sample that corresponds to 21% of variance explained. Number of episodes, side effects, delusional features, baseline HAM-D, length of current episode, lithium augmentation, current medical condition and personality disorders were the main factors identified by the model. Sex, age at onset, polarity, plasma level and baseline VAS score were part of the model but with a lower rank. Overall, our findings suggest that neural networks could be a valid technique for the analysis of psychopharmacology studies. The complex interactions modelled through ANN may be eventually applied at the clinical level for the individualized therapy."
Risk factor identification and mortality prediction in cardiac surgery using artificial neural networks,other,"neural network, artificial neural network","OBJECTIVE: The artificial neural network model is a nonlinear technology useful for complex pattern recognition problems. This study aimed to develop a method to select risk variables and predict mortality after cardiac surgery by using artificial neural networks.
METHODS: Prospectively collected data from 18,362 patients undergoing cardiac surgery at 128 European institutions in 1995 (the European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation database) were used. Models to predict the operative mortality were constructed using artificial neural networks. For calibration a sixfold cross-validation technique was used, and for testing a fourfold cross-testing was performed. Risk variables were ranked and minimized in number by calibrated artificial neural networks. Mortality prediction with 95% confidence limits for each patient was obtained by the bootstrap technique. The area under the receiver operating characteristics curve was used as a quantitative measure of the ability to distinguish between survivors and nonsurvivors. Subgroup analysis of surgical operation categories was performed. The results were compared with those from logistic European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation analysis.
RESULTS: The operative mortality was 4.9%. Artificial neural networks selected 34 of the total 72 risk variables as relevant for mortality prediction. The receiver operating characteristics area for artificial neural networks (0.81) was larger than the logistic European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation model (0.79; P = .0001). For different surgical operation categories, there were no differences in the discriminatory power for the artificial neural networks (P = .15) but significant differences were found for the logistic European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation (P = .0072).
CONCLUSIONS: Risk factors in a ranked order contributing to the mortality prediction were identified. A minimal set of risk variables achieving a superior mortality prediction was defined. The artificial neural network model is applicable independent of the cardiac surgical procedure."
An artificial neural network improves prediction of observed survival in patients with laryngeal squamous carcinoma,other,neural network,"The accepted method of modelling and predicting failure/survival, Cox's proportional hazards model, is theoretically inferior to neural network derived models for analysing highly complex systems with large datasets. A blinded comparison of the neural network versus the Cox's model in predicting survival utilising data from 873 treated patients with laryngeal cancer. These were divided randomly and equally into a training set and a study set and Cox's and neural network models applied in turn. Data were then divided into seven sets of binary covariates and the analysis repeated. Overall survival was not significantly different on Kaplan-Meier plot, or with either test model. Although the network produced qualitatively similar results to Cox's model it was significantly more sensitive to differences in survival curves for age and N stage. We propose that neural networks are capable of prediction in systems involving complex interactions between variables and non-linearity."
Comparison of diagnostic usefulness of predictive models in preliminary differentiation of adnexal masses,other,"neural network, artificial neural network","The purpose of this study was to compare prognostic models evaluating the probability of an ovarian cancer occurrence based on a number of clinical and ultrasonographic data in women with adnexal masses. A total of 686 women with adnexal masses underwent the examinations between 1994 and 2002. The recorded parameters included: age, menopausal status, body mass index, the grayscale and Doppler ultrasonographic examination, and selected markers concentration levels. In order to find the best combination of features, which significantly influences the probability of malignancy, stepwise logistic regression analysis, as well as artificial neural network, was used. The diagnostic efficiency of received models was estimated and compared using receiver-operating characteristics (ROC) curve. The results indicate that 431 and 255 patients had a benign and malignant ovarian tumor, respectively. Application of stepwise logistic regression analysis revealed statistically significant importance of eight features. The sensitivity and specificity for the received model were 65.71% and 77.59%, respectively. Three-layer perceptron network shows 13 features as significant predictors of malignancy. The network gave a sensitivity of 85.7% and specificity of 93.1%. Comparison of area under ROC curve for received models was 0.9679 vs 0.9716. Prognostic values of the analyzed neural model are not optimal but seem to surpass logistic regression model in terms of the predictive possibilities."
Comparison of artificial neural network and logistic regression models for prediction of mortality in head trauma based on initial clinical data,other,"neural network, artificial neural network","BACKGROUND: In recent years, outcome prediction models using artificial neural network and multivariable logistic regression analysis have been developed in many areas of health care research. Both these methods have advantages and disadvantages. In this study we have compared the performance of artificial neural network and multivariable logistic regression models, in prediction of outcomes in head trauma and studied the reproducibility of the findings.
METHODS: 1000 Logistic regression and ANN models based on initial clinical data related to the GCS, tracheal intubation status, age, systolic blood pressure, respiratory rate, pulse rate, injury severity score and the outcome of 1271 mainly head injured patients were compared in this study. For each of one thousand pairs of ANN and logistic models, the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, Hosmer-Lemeshow (HL) statistics and accuracy rate were calculated and compared using paired T-tests.
RESULTS: ANN significantly outperformed logistic models in both fields of discrimination and calibration but under performed in accuracy. In 77.8% of cases the area under the ROC curves and in 56.4% of cases the HL statistics for the neural network model were superior to that for the logistic model. In 68% of cases the accuracy of the logistic model was superior to the neural network model.
CONCLUSIONS: ANN significantly outperformed the logistic models in both fields of discrimination and calibration but lagged behind in accuracy. This study clearly showed that any single comparison between these two models might not reliably represent the true end results. External validation of the designed models, using larger databases with different rates of outcomes is necessary to get an accurate measure of performance outside the development population."
[Study on the application of artificial neural network in analysing the risk factors of diabetes mellitus],other,neural network,"OBJECTIVE: To study the use of neural network in determining the risk factors of diseases.
METHODS: With back-propagation neural network (BP network) as fitting model based upon data gathered from an epidemiological survey on diabetes mellitus and under the network structure of 22-6-1, the mean impact value (MIV) for each input variables and sequencing the factors according to their absolute MIVs were calculated. The results from BP network with multiple logistic regression analysis and log-linear model for united actions between factors were compared with optimizing Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm.
RESULTS: By BP network analysis, the sequence of importance for the risk factors of diabetes mellitus became: faster pulse, diabetes mellitus family history, living longer in the investigated area, with medical record of nephropathy, having higher ratio for waist-to-hip, being male, with medical records of diseases as hyperlipoproteinmia, coronary heart disease, hypertension, high diastolic pressure, higher income, do no drink alcohol, age, higher systolic pressure, less educated, body mass index, with medical records of other diseases, physical exercise related to jobs smoking, occupation, with medical record for cerebrovascular disease, with medical record for liver disease etc. However, only 7 factors were statistically significant in multiple logistic regression analysis. The sequence of their importance appeared as: pulse, diabetes mellitus family history, the medical record of nephropathy, waist-to-hip ratio, the medical record of hypertension, work-place related exercise and age. The sequences of importance were almost the same between the two while the difference could partly be explained by the interaction among risk factors through log-linear model.
CONCLUSION: Neural network could be used to analyze the risk factors of diseases and could assimilate more complicated relationships (main effects and interactions) between inputs and outputs, better than using the traditional methods."
Forecasting model for the incidence of hepatitis A based on artificial neural network,other,"neural network, artificial neural network","AIM: To study the application of artificial neural network (ANN) in forecasting the incidence of hepatitis A, which had an autoregression phenomenon.
METHODS: The data of the incidence of hepatitis A in Liaoning Province from 1981 to 2001 were obtained from Liaoning Disease Control and Prevention Center. We used the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model of time series analysis to determine whether there was any autoregression phenomenon in the data. Then the data of the incidence were switched into [0,1] intervals as the network theoretical output. The data from 1981 to 1997 were used as the training and verifying sets and the data from 1998 to 2001 were made up into the test set. STATISTICA neural network (ST NN) was used to construct, train and simulate the artificial neural network.
RESULTS: Twenty-four networks were tested and seven were retained. The best network we found had excellent performance, its regression ratio was 0.73, and its correlation was 0.69. There were 2 input variables in the network, one was AR(1), and the other was time. The number of units in hidden layer was 3. In ARIMA time series analysis results, the best model was first order autoregression without difference and smoothness. The total sum square error of the ANN model was 9 090.21, the sum square error of the training set and testing set was 8 377.52 and 712.69, respectively, they were all less than that of ARIMA model. The corresponding value of ARIMA was 12 291.79, 8 944.95 and 3 346.84, respectively. The correlation coefficient of nonlinear regression (R(NL)) of ANN was 0.71, while the R(NL) of ARIMA linear autoregression model was 0.66.
CONCLUSION: ANN is superior to conventional methods in forecasting the incidence of hepatitis A which has an autoregression phenomenon."
An artificial neural network ensemble to predict disposition and length of stay in children presenting with bronchiolitis,other,"neural network, artificial neural network","BACKGROUND: Artificial neural networks apply complex non-linear functions to pattern recognition problems. An ensemble is a 'committee' of neural networks that usually outperforms single neural networks. Bronchiolitis is a common manifestation of viral lower respiratory tract infection in infants and toddlers.
OBJECTIVE: To train artificial neural network ensembles to predict the disposition and length of stay in children presenting to the Emergency Department with bronchiolitis.
METHODS: A specifically constructed database of 119 episodes of bronchiolitis was used to train, validate, and test a neural network ensemble. We used EasyNN 7.0 on a 200 Mhz pentium PC with a maths co-processor. The ensemble of neural networks constructed was subjected to fivefold validation. Comparison with actual and predicted dispositions was measured using the kappa statistic for disposition and the Kaplan-Meier estimations and log rank test for predictions of length of stay.
RESULTS: The neural network ensembles correctly predicted disposition in 81% (range 75-90%) of test cases. When compared with actual disposition the neural network performed similarly to a logistic regression model and significantly better than various 'dumb machine' strategies with which we compared it. The prediction of length of stay was poorer, 65% (range 60-80%), but the difference between observed and predicted lengths of stay were not significantly different.
CONCLUSION: Artificial neural network ensembles can predict disposition for infants and toddlers with bronchiolitis; however, the prediction of length of hospital stay is not as good."
Comparison of logistic regression and neural network analysis applied to predicting living setting after hip fracture,other,"neural network, artificial neural network","PURPOSE: Describe and compare the characteristics of artificial neural networks and logistic regression to develop prediction models in epidemiological research.
METHODS: The sample included 3708 persons with hip fracture from 46 different states included in the Uniform Data System for Medical Rehabilitation. Mean age was 75.5 years (sd=14.2), 73.7% of patients were female, and 82% were non-Hispanic white. Average length of stay was 17.0 days (sd=10.6). The primary outcome measure was living setting (at home vs. not at home) at 80 to 180 days after discharge.
RESULTS: Statistically significant variables (p <.05) in the logistic model included follow-up therapy, sphincter control, self-care ability, marital status, age, and length of stay. Areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves were 0.67 for logistic regression and 0.73 for neural network analysis. Calibration curves indicated a slightly better fit for the neural network model.
CONCLUSIONS: Follow-up therapy and independent bowel and/or bladder function were strong predictors of living at home up to 6 months after hospitalization for hip fracture. No practical differences were found between the predictive ability of logistic regression and neural network analysis in this sample."
"Potential assessment of a neural network model with PCA/RBF approach for forecasting pollutant trends in Mong Kok urban air, Hong Kong",other,neural network,"The forecasting of air pollutant trends has received much attention in recent years. It is an important and popular topic in environmental science, as concerns have been raised about the health impacts caused by unacceptable ambient air pollutant levels. Of greatest concern are metropolitan cities like Hong Kong. In Hong Kong, respirable suspended particulates (RSP), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) are major air pollutants due to the dominant usage of diesel fuel by commercial vehicles and buses. Hence, the study of the influence and the trends relating to these pollutants is extremely significant to the public health and the image of the city. The use of neural network techniques to predict trends relating to air pollutants is regarded as a reliable and cost-effective method for the task of prediction. The works reported here involve developing an improved neural network model that combines both the principal component analysis technique and the radial basis function network and forecasts pollutant tendencies based on a recorded database. Compared with general neural network models, the proposed model features a more simple network architecture, a faster training speed, and a more satisfactory prediction performance. The improved model was evaluated with hourly time series of RSP, NOx and NO2 concentrations monitored at the Mong Kok Roadside Gaseous Monitory Station in Hong Kong during the year 2000 and proved to be effective. The model developed is a potential tool for forecasting air quality parameters and is superior to traditional neural network methods."
Qualitative diagnosis of calvarial metastasis by neural network and logistic regression,other,"neural network, artificial neural network","RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: To simplify the diagnostic features used by an artificial neural network compared with logistic regression (LR) in the diagnosis of calvarial metastasis with computed tomography and analyze their accuracy.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-one of 167 patients with calvarial lesions were found to have metastasis. Clinical and computed tomography data were used for LR and neural network models. Both models were tested with the leave-one-out method. The final results of each model were compared using the area under receiver operating characteristic curve (Az).
RESULTS: The neural network identified metastasis significantly more successfully than LR with an Az of 0.9324 +/- 0.0386 versus 0.9192 +/- 0.0373, P = .01. The most important features selected by the LR and neural network were age and edge definition.
CONCLUSION: Neural networks offer wide possibilities over statistics for the study of calvarial metastases other than their minimum clinical and radiologic features for diagnosis."
Selecting pre-screening items for early intervention trials of dementia--a case study,other,neural network,"Our goal was to review and extend statistical methods for discriminating between normal subjects and those with dementia or cognitive impairment. We compared six different methods to one constructed by expert opinion, in their brevity and predictive power. The methods include logistic regression and neural networks, with standard and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) variable selection, as well as decision trees with and without boosting. These methods were applied to the baseline data of a subgroup of subjects in a dementia study, using their screening interview items to predict their clinical diagnosis of normal or non-normal (cognitively impaired or demented). The derived models were then validated on a different subgroup of subjects in the same study who had the screening and clinical diagnosis two to five years later. Performance of different models was compared based on their sensitivity and specificity in the validation sample. Generally, the six statistical methods performed slightly to moderately better than the expert-opinion model. Neural networks generally performed better than the logistic and decision tree models. LASSO improved the performance of logistic and neural network models, but it eliminated few input variables in the neural network. The single decision tree performed at least as well as the standard logistic model, and with fewer items, making it an attractive pre-screening tool. Using the boosting option for decision trees did not substantially improve the performance. We recommend that for each situation, different methods of classification should be attempted to obtain optimal results for a given purpose."
Evaluation of the ability of an artificial neural network model to assess the variation of groundwater quality in an area of blackfoot disease in Taiwan,other,"neural network, artificial neural network","The back-propagation (BP) artificial neural network (ANN) is applied to forecast the variation of the quality of groundwater in the blackfoot disease area in Taiwan. Three types of BP ANN models were established to evaluate their learning performance. Model A included five concentration parameters as input variables for seawater intrusion and three concentration parameters as input variables for arsenic pollutant, respectively, whereas models B and C used only one concentration parameter for each. Furthermore, model C used seasonal data from two seasons to train the ANN, whereas models A and C used only data from one season. The results indicate that model C outperforms models A and B. Model C can describe complex variation of groundwater quality and be used to perform reliable forecasting. Moreover, the number of hidden nodes does not significantly influence the performance of the ANN model in training or testing."
Optimization of neural network architecture using genetic programming improves detection and modeling of gene-gene interactions in studies of human diseases,other,neural network,"BACKGROUND: Appropriate definition of neural network architecture prior to data analysis is crucial for successful data mining. This can be challenging when the underlying model of the data is unknown. The goal of this study was to determine whether optimizing neural network architecture using genetic programming as a machine learning strategy would improve the ability of neural networks to model and detect nonlinear interactions among genes in studies of common human diseases.
RESULTS: Using simulated data, we show that a genetic programming optimized neural network approach is able to model gene-gene interactions as well as a traditional back propagation neural network. Furthermore, the genetic programming optimized neural network is better than the traditional back propagation neural network approach in terms of predictive ability and power to detect gene-gene interactions when non-functional polymorphisms are present.
CONCLUSION: This study suggests that a machine learning strategy for optimizing neural network architecture may be preferable to traditional trial-and-error approaches for the identification and characterization of gene-gene interactions in common, complex human diseases."
Neural networks in the prediction of survival in patients with colorectal cancer,other,neural network,"It is important to predict outcome for colorectal cancer patients following surgery, as almost 50% of patients undergoing a potentially curative resection will experience relapse. It is clear that present prognostic categories such as Dukes or TNM staging are too broad, and further refining is required to prognosticate for high-risk subgroups. One approach is to determine a phenotype associated with recurrence. We compared 2 methods of analyzing such data. Pathologic data from a large clinical trial was analyzed for 403 patients. The outcome modeled was disease recurrence. The results from logistic regression analysis and a neural network approach are compared with respect to receiver operator characteristic plots, which estimate the fit of the model. The best logistic regression model gives a result of 66%, and the neural network approach 78%. The conclusion from this study is that the neural network approach is superior to regression analysis. Further analyses are in progress using a larger patient sample size (n > 1000), improved statistical models, and a more refined neural network."
Neural networks morbidity and mortality modeling during loss of HIV T-cell homeostasis,other,neural network,"Despite the proven clinical benefits of HAART, mortality may still occur; particularly in those with less than 50 CD4+ cells/mL and, in some cases, with a viral burden below detectable plasma levels of HIV-1 RNA. Multiple factors may predict mortality including initial response to therapy, viral factors and host immune parameters. Due to the complexity of this problem, we developed Artificial Intelligence based tools/Neural Network (NN) to optimally evaluate outcomes of therapy and predict morbidity and mortality. To further validate the accuracy of these tools, we challenged their performance with that of Cox regression modeling (RM). Our study population involved 116 HIV+ individuals who consistently maintained CD4+ count < 50 cells/mL for over 6 months. All patients were treated with antiretrovirals. To assess clinical outcomes, we developed a feedforward back-propagation Neural Network. We then compared the performance of this network to a Cox regression model. The Neural Network outscored the Cox regression model in the ROC curve areas: 0.888 vs 0.760 (HIV+ first Seropositivity to AIDS), 0.901 vs 0.758 (HIV+ first Seropositivity to Last Assessment incl. death) and 0.832 vs 0.799 (AIDS to Last Assessment incl. death), for the NN & Cox, respectively. In patients with a history of AIDS defining events and with severe T-Cell depletion, mortality occurs despite therapy. Although Neural Networks and Cox modeling were successful in predicting mortality, the Neural Network was superior in assessing risk in this population."
Prediction models in the design of neural network based ECG classifiers: a neural network and genetic programming approach,other,neural network,"BACKGROUND: Classification of the electrocardiogram using Neural Networks has become a widely used method in recent years. The efficiency of these classifiers depends upon a number of factors including network training. Unfortunately, there is a shortage of evidence available to enable specific design choices to be made and as a consequence, many designs are made on the basis of trial and error. In this study we develop prediction models to indicate the point at which training should stop for Neural Network based Electrocardiogram classifiers in order to ensure maximum generalisation.
METHODS: Two prediction models have been presented; one based on Neural Networks and the other on Genetic Programming. The inputs to the models were 5 variable training parameters and the output indicated the point at which training should stop. Training and testing of the models was based on the results from 44 previously developed bi-group Neural Network classifiers, discriminating between Anterior Myocardial Infarction and normal patients.
RESULTS: Our results show that both approaches provide close fits to the training data; p = 0.627 and p = 0.304 for the Neural Network and Genetic Programming methods respectively. For unseen data, the Neural Network exhibited no significant differences between actual and predicted outputs (p = 0.306) while the Genetic Programming method showed a marginally significant difference (p = 0.047).
CONCLUSIONS: The approaches provide reverse engineering solutions to the development of Neural Network based Electrocardiogram classifiers. That is given the network design and architecture, an indication can be given as to when training should stop to obtain maximum network generalisation."
Recurrent neural networks for predicting outcomes after liver transplantation: representing temporal sequence of clinical observations,other,"neural network, recurrent neural network","OBJECTIVES: This paper investigates a version of recurrent neural network with the backpropagation through time (BPTT) algorithm for predicting liver transplant graft failure based on a time series sequence of clinical observations. The objective is to improve upon the current approaches to liver transplant outcome prediction by developing a more complete model that takes into account not only the preoperative risk assessment, but also the early postoperative history.
METHODS: A 6-fold cross-validation procedure was used to measure the performance of the networks. The data set was divided into a learning set and a test set by maintaining the same proportion of positive and negative cases in the original set. The effects of network complexity on overfitting were investigated by constructing two types of networks with different numbers of hidden units. For each type of network, 10 individual networks were trained on the learning set and used to form a committee. The performance of the networks was measured exhaustively with respect to both the entire training and test sets.
RESULTS: The networks were capable of learning the time series problem and achieved good performances of 90% correct classification on the learning set and 78% on the test set. The prediction accuracy increases as more information becomes progressively available after the operation with the daily improvement of 10% on the learning set and 5% on the test set.
CONCLUSIONS: Recurrent neural networks trained with BPTT algorithm are capable of learning to represent temporal behavior of the time series prediction task. This model is an improvement upon the current model that does not take into account postoperative temporal information."
Comparison of the prediction of extremely low birth weight neonatal mortality by regression analysis and by neural networks,other,"neural network, artificial neural network","AIMS: To compare the prediction of mortality in individual extremely low birth weight (ELBW) neonates by regression analysis and by artificial neural networks.
STUDY DESIGN: A database of 23 variables on 810 ELBW neonates admitted to a tertiary care center was divided into training, validation, and test sets. Logistic regression and neural network models were developed on the training set, validated, and outcome (mortality) predicted on the test set. Stepwise regression identified significant variables in the full set. Regression models and neural networks were then tested using data sets with only the identified significant variables, and then with variables excluded one at a time.
RESULTS: The area under the curve (AUC) of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves for neural networks and regression was similar (AUC 0.87+/-0.03; p=0.31). Birthweight or gestational age and the 5-min Apgar score contributed most to AUC.
CONCLUSIONS: Both neural networks and regression analysis predicted mortality with reasonable accuracy. For both models, analyzing selected variables was superior to full data set analysis. We speculate neural networks may not be superior to regression when no clear non-linear relationships exist."
Understanding neural networks using regression trees: an application to multiple myeloma survival data,other,neural network,"Neural networks are becoming very popular tools for analysing data. It is however quite difficult to understand the neural network output in terms of the original covariates or input variables. In this paper we provide, using readily available software, an easy way of understanding the output of the neural network using regression trees. We focus on the problem in the context of censored survival data for patients with multiple myeloma, where identifying groups of patients with different prognosis is an important aspect of clinical studies. The use of regression trees to help understand neural networks can be easily applied to uncensored situations."
Simplified risk score models accurately predict the risk of major in-hospital complications following percutaneous coronary intervention,other,neural network,"The objectives of this analysis were to develop and validate simplified risk score models for predicting the risk of major in-hospital complications after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in the era of widespread stenting and use of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antagonists. We then sought to compare the performance of these simplified models with those of full logistic regression and neural network models. From January 1, 1997 to December 31, 1999, data were collected on 4,264 consecutive interventional procedures at a single center. Risk score models were derived from multiple logistic regression models using the first 2,804 cases and then validated on the final 1,460 cases. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve for the risk score model that predicted death was 0.86 compared with 0.85 for the multiple logistic model and 0.83 for the neural network model (validation set). For the combined end points of death, myocardial infarction, or bypass surgery, the corresponding areas under the ROC curves were 0.74, 0.78, and 0.81, respectively. Previously identified risk factors were confirmed in this analysis. The use of stents was associated with a decreased risk of in-hospital complications. Thus, risk score models can accurately predict the risk of major in-hospital complications after PCI. Their discriminatory power is comparable to those of logistic models and neural network models. Accurate bedside risk stratification may be achieved with these simple models."
Neural network and regression predictions of 5-year survival after colon carcinoma treatment,other,"neural network, artificial neural network","BACKGROUND: The Commission on Cancer data from the National Cancer Data Base (NCDB) for patients with colon carcinoma was used to develop several artificial neural network and regression-based models. These models were designed to predict the likelihood of 5-year survival after primary treatment for colon carcinoma.
METHODS: Two modeling methods were used in the study. Artificial neural networks were used to select the more important variables from the NCDB database and model 5-year survival. A standard parametric logistic regression also was used to model survival and the two methods compared on a prospective set of patients not used in model development.
RESULTS: The neural network yielded a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) area of 87.6%. At a sensitivity to mortality of 95% the specificity was 41%. The logistic regression yielded a ROC area of 82% and at a sensitivity to mortality of 95% gave a specificity of 27%.
CONCLUSIONS: The neural network found a strong pattern in the database predictive of 5-year survival status. The logistic regression produced somewhat less accurate, but good, results."
Risk stratification in heart failure using artificial neural networks,other,neural network,"Accurate risk stratification of heart failure patients is critical to improve management and outcomes. Heart failure is a complex multisystem disease in which several predictors are categorical. Neural network models have successfully been applied to several medical classification problems. Using a simple neural network, we assessed one-year prognosis in 132 patients, consecutively admitted with heart failure, by classifying them in 3 groups: death, readmission and one-year event-free survival. Given the small number of cases, the neural network model was trained using a resampling method. We identified relevant predictors using the Automatic Relevance Determination (ARD) method, and estimated their mean effect on the 3 different outcomes. Only 9 individuals were misclassified. Neural networks have the potential to be a useful tool for making prognosis in the domain of heart failure."
Visualizing the function computed by a feedforward neural network,other,"neural network, feedforward neural network","A method for visualizing the function computed by a feedforward neural network is presented. It is most suitable for models with continuous inputs and a small number of outputs, where the output function is reasonably smooth, as in regression and probabilistic classification tasks. The visualization makes readily apparent the effects of each input and the way in which the functions deviate from a linear function. The visualization can also assist in identifying interactions in the fitted model. The method uses only the input-output relationship and thus can be applied to any predictive statistical model, including bagged and committee models, which are otherwise difficult to interpret. The visualization method is demonstrated on a neural network model of how the risk of lung cancer is affected by smoking and drinking."
Neural network analysis of follow-up data in primary breast cancer,other,neural network,"This paper reports on the performance of a recently developed neural network environment incorporating likelihood-based optimization and complexity reduction techniques in the analysis of breast cancer follow-up data with the goal of building up a clinical decision support system. The inputs to the neural network include classical factors such as grading, age, tumor size, estrogen and progesterone receptor measurements, as well as tumor biological markers such as PAI-1 and uPA. The network learns the structural relationship between these factors and the follow-up data. Examples of neural models for relapse-free survival are presented, which are based on data from 784 breast cancer patients who received their primary therapy at the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Technische Universität München, Germany. The performance of the neural analysis as quantified by various indicators (likelihood, Kaplan-Meier curves, log-rank tests) was very high. For example, dividing the patients into two equally sized groups based on the neural score (i.e., cutoff = median score) leads to an estimated difference in relapse-free survival of 40% or better (80% vs. 40%) after 10 years in Kaplan-Meier analysis. Evidence for factor interactions as well as for time-varying impacts is presented. The neural network weights included in the models are significant at the 5% level. The use of neural network analysis and scoring in combination with strong tumor biological factors such as uPA and PAI-1 appears to result in a very effective risk group discrimination. Considerable additional comparison of data from different patient series will be required to establish the generalization capability more firmly. Nonetheless, the improvement of risk group discrimination represents an important step toward the use of neural networks for decision support in a clinical framework and in making the most of biological markers."
Artificial neural networks applied to survival prediction in breast cancer,other,"neural network, artificial neural network","In this study, we evaluated the accuracy of a neural network in predicting 5-, 10- and 15-year breast-cancer-specific survival. A series of 951 breast cancer patients was divided into a training set of 651 and a validation set of 300 patients. Eight variables were entered as input to the network: tumor size, axillary nodal status, histological type, mitotic count, nuclear pleomorphism, tubule formation, tumor necrosis and age. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) was used as a measure of accuracy of the prediction models in generating survival estimates for the patients in the independent validation set. The AUC values of the neural network models for 5-, 10- and 15-year breast-cancer-specific survival were 0.909, 0.886 and 0.883, respectively. The corresponding AUC values for logistic regression were 0.897, 0.862 and 0.858. Axillary lymph node status (N0 vs. N+) predicted 5-year survival with a specificity of 71% and a sensitivity of 77%. The sensitivity of the neural network model was 91% at this specificity level. The rate of false predictions at 5 years was 82/300 for nodal status and 40/300 for the neural network. When nodal status was excluded from the neural network model, the rate of false predictions increased only to 49/300 (AUC 0. 877). An artificial neural network is very accurate in the 5-, 10- and 15-year breast-cancer-specific survival prediction. The consistently high accuracy over time and the good predictive performance of a network trained without information on nodal status demonstrate that neural networks can be important tools for cancer survival prediction."
Predicting active pulmonary tuberculosis using an artificial neural network,other,"neural network, artificial neural network","BACKGROUND: Nosocomial outbreaks of tuberculosis (TB) have been attributed to unrecognized pulmonary TB. Accurate assessment in identifying index cases of active TB is essential in preventing transmission of the disease.
OBJECTIVES: To develop an artificial neural network using clinical and radiographic information to predict active pulmonary TB at the time of presentation at a health-care facility that is superior to physicians' opinion.
DESIGN: Nonconcurrent prospective study.
SETTING: University-affiliated hospital.
PARTICIPANTS: A derivation group of 563 isolation episodes and a validation group of 119 isolation episodes.
INTERVENTIONS: A general regression neural network (GRNN) was used to develop the predictive model.
MEASUREMENTS: Predictive accuracy of the neural network compared with clinicians' assessment.
RESULTS: Predictive accuracy was assessed by the c-index, which is equivalent to the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. The GRNN significantly outperformed the physicians' prediction, with calculated c-indices (+/- SEM) of 0.947 +/- 0.028 and 0.61 +/- 0.045, respectively (p < 0.001). When the GRNN was applied to the validation group, the corresponding c-indices were 0. 923 +/- 0.056 and 0.716 +/- 0.095, respectively.
CONCLUSION: An artificial neural network can identify patients with active pulmonary TB more accurately than physicians' clinical assessment."
Effect of an artificial neural network on radiologists' performance in the differential diagnosis of interstitial lung disease using chest radiographs,other,"neural network, artificial neural network","OBJECTIVE: We developed a new method to distinguish between various interstitial lung diseases that uses an artificial neural network. This network is based on features extracted from chest radiographs and clinical parameters. The aim of our study was to evaluate the effect of the output from the artificial neural network on radiologists' diagnostic accuracy.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The artificial neural network was designed to differentiate among 11 interstitial lung diseases using 10 clinical parameters and 16 radiologic findings. Thirty-three clinical cases (three cases for each lung disease) were selected. In the observer test, chest radiographs were viewed by eight radiologists (four attending physicians and four residents) with and without network output, which indicated the likelihood of each of the 11 possible diagnoses in each case. The radiologists' performance in distinguishing among the 11 interstitial lung diseases was evaluated by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis with a continuous rating scale.
RESULTS: When chest radiographs were viewed in conjunction with network output, a statistically significant improvement in diagnostic accuracy was achieved (p < .0001). The average area under the ROC curve was .826 without network output and .911 with network output.
CONCLUSION: An artificial neural network can provide a useful ""second opinion"" to assist radiologists in the differential diagnosis of interstitial lung disease using chest radiographs."
A neural network approach to the diagnosis of morbidity outcomes in trauma care,other,"neural network, artificial neural network","This paper introduces the application of artificial neural networks to trauma complications assessment. The potential financial benefits of improving on trauma center diagnostic specificity in complications assessment are illustrated and the operational feasibility of the use of diagnostic neural models across institutions is discussed. A prototype neural network model is described, which, after training, succeeds in diagnosing the complication of sepsis in victims of traumatic blunt injury. Its diagnostic performance with 100% sensitivity and 96.5% specificity is accomplished with test data from a regional trauma center. The model is further shown to have correctly detected, during training, incorrectly coded data. The potential this suggests, for parsimonious database scrubbing through the use of neural network models, is discussed."
Experiments to determine whether recursive partitioning (CART) or an artificial neural network overcomes theoretical limitations of Cox proportional hazards regression,other,"neural network, artificial neural network","New computationally intensive tools for medical survival analyses include recursive patitioning (also called CART) and artificial neural networks. A challenge that remains is to better understand the behavior of these techniques in effort to know when they will be effective tools. Theoretically they may overcome limitations of the traditional multivariable survival technique, the Cox proportional hazards regression model. Experiments were designed to test whether the new tools would, in practice, overcome these limitations. Two datasets in which theory suggests CART and the neural network should outperform the Cox model were selected. The first was a published leukemia dataset manipulated to have a strong interaction that CART should detect. The second was a published cirrhosis dataset with pronounced nonlinear effects that a neural network should fit. Repeated sampling of 50 training and testing subsets was applied to each technique. The concordance index C was calculated as a measure of predictive accuracy by each technique on the testing dataset. In the interaction dataset, CART outperformed Cox (P < 0.05) with a C improvement of 0.1 (95% CI, 0.08 to 0.12). In the nonlinear dataset, the neural network outperformed the Cox model (P < 0.05), but by a very slight amount (0.015). As predicted by theory, CART and the neural network were able to overcome limitations of the Cox model. Experiments like these are important to increase our understanding of when one of these new techniques will outperform the standard Cox model. Further research is necessary to predict which technique will do best a priori and to assess the magnitude of superiority."
Predicting mortality after coronary artery bypass surgery: what do artificial neural networks learn? The Steering Committee of the Cardiac Care Network of Ontario,other,"neural network, artificial neural network","OBJECTIVE: To compare the abilities of artificial neural network and logistic regression models to predict the risk of in-hospital mortality after coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery.
METHODS: Neural network and logistic regression models were developed using a training set of 4,782 patients undergoing CABG surgery in Ontario, Canada, in 1991, and they were validated in two test sets of 5,309 and 5,517 patients having CABG surgery in 1992 and 1993, respectively.
RESULTS: The probabilities predicted from a fully trained neural network were similar to those of a ""saturated"" regression model, with both models detecting all possible interactions in the training set and validating poorly in the two test sets. A second neural network was developed by cross-validating a network against a new set of data and terminating network training early to create a more generalizable model. A simple ""main effects"" regression model without any interaction terms was also developed. Both of these models validated well, with areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves of 0.78 and 0.77 (p > 0.10) in the 1993 test set. The predictions from the two models were very highly correlated (r=0.95).
CONCLUSIONS: Artificial neural networks and logistic regression models learn similar relationships between patient characteristics and mortality after CABG surgery."
Prediction and cross-validation of neural networks versus logistic regression: using hepatic disorders as an example,other,neural network,"The authors developed and cross-validated prediction models for newly diagnosed cases of liver disorders by using logistic regression and neural networks. Computerized files of health care encounters from the Fallon Community Health Plan were used to identify 1,674 subjects who had had liver-related health services between July 1, 1992, and June 30, 1993. A total of 219 subjects were confirmed by review of medical records as incident cases. The 1,674 subjects were randomly and evenly divided into training and test sets. The training set was used to derive prediction algorithms based solely on the automated data; the test set was used for cross-validation. The area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve for a neural network model was significantly larger than that for logistic regression in the training set (p = 0.04). However, the performance was statistically equivalent in the test set (p = 0.45). Despite its superior performance in the training set, the generalizability of the neural network model is limited. Logistic regression may therefore be preferred over neural network on the basis of its established advantages. More generalizable modeling techniques for neural networks may be necessary before they are practical for medical research."
Artificial neural networks applied to outcome prediction for colorectal cancer patients in separate institutions,other,"neural network, artificial neural network","BACKGROUND: Artificial neural networks are computer programs that can be used to discover complex relations within data sets. They permit the recognition of patterns in complex biological data sets that cannot be detected with conventional linear statistical analysis. One such complex problem is the prediction of outcome for individual patients treated for colorectal cancer. Predictions of outcome in such patients have traditionally been based on population statistics. However, these predictions have little meaning for the individual patient. We report the training of neural networks to predict outcome for individual patients from one institution and their predictive performance on data from a different institution in another region.
METHODS: 5-year follow-up data from 334 patients treated for colorectal cancer were used to train and validate six neural networks designed for the prediction of death within 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, and 24 months. The previously trained 12-month neural network was then applied to 2-year follow-up data from patients from a second institution; outcome was concealed. No further training of the neural network was undertaken. The network's predictions were compared with those of two consultant colorectal surgeons supplied with the same data.
FINDINGS: All six neural networks were able to achieve overall accuracy greater than 80% for the prediction of death for individual patients at institution 1 within 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, and 24 months. The mean sensitivity and specificity were 60% and 88%. When the neural network trained to predict death within 12 months was applied to data from the second institution, overall accuracy of 90% (95% CI 84-96) was achieved, compared with the overall accuracy of the colorectal surgeons of 79% (71-87) and 75% (66-84).
INTERPRETATION: The neural networks were able to predict outcome for individual patients with colorectal cancer much more accurately than the currently available clinicopathological methods. Once trained on data from one institution, the neural networks were able to predict outcome for patients from an unrelated institution."
Coronary artery bypass risk prediction using neural networks,other,"neural network, multilayer perceptron","BACKGROUND: Neural networks are nonparametric, robust, pattern recognition techniques that can be used to model complex relationships.
METHODS: The applicability of multilayer perceptron neural networks (MLP) to coronary artery bypass grafting risk prediction was assessed using The Society of Thoracic Surgeons database of 80,606 patients who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting in 1993. The results of traditional logistic regression and Bayesian analysis were compared with single-layer (no hidden layer), two-layer (one hidden layer), and three-layer (two hidden layer) MLP neural networks. These networks were trained using stochastic gradient descent with early stopping. All prediction models used the same variables and were evaluated by training on 40,480 patients and cross-validation testing on a separate group of 40,126 patients. Techniques were also developed to calculate effective odds ratios for MLP networks and to generate confidence intervals for MLP risk predictions using an auxiliary ""confidence MLP.""
RESULTS: Receiver operating characteristic curve areas for predicting mortality were approximately 76% for all classifiers, including neural networks. Calibration (accuracy of posterior probability prediction) was slightly better with a two-member committee classifier that averaged the outputs of a MLP network and a logistic regression model. Unlike the individual methods, the committee classifier did not overestimate or underestimate risk for high-risk patients.
CONCLUSIONS: A committee classifier combining the best neural network and logistic regression provided the best model calibration, but the receiver operating characteristic curve area was only 76% irrespective of which predictive model was used."
Use of a probabilistic neural network to estimate the risk of mortality after cardiac surgery,other,neural network,"OBJECTIVE: To develop a probabilistic neural network (PNN) to estimate mortality risk following cardiac surgery.
DESIGN AND SETTING: The PNN model was created using an institutional database obtained as part of routine quality assurance activity. Patient records (from 1991 to 1993) were randomly divided into training (n = 732) and validation (n = 380) sets. The model uses seven variables, each obtainable during routine clinical patient care. After completion of the initial validation phase, newer data (1994) became available and were used as an independent source of validation (n = 365).
PATIENTS: 1,477 consecutive cardiac surgery patients operated on in a teaching hospital during a four-year period (1991-94).
RESULTS: The overall accuracy of the neural network was 91.5% in the training set; it was 92.3% in the validation set. The model was well calibrated (p = 0.21 for the Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test) and discriminated well (areas under the ROC curves were 0.72 and 0.81 for the training and validation sets). The trained network also performed well on the 1994 data (ROC = 0.74, p = 0.19 for the Hosmer-Lemeshow test), albeit with a slight decrement in overall accuracy (88.2%).
CONCLUSION: A neural network may be implemented to estimate mortality risk following cardiac surgery. Implementation is relatively rapid, and it is an alternative to standard statistical approaches."
Artificial neural networks for molecular sequence analysis,other,"neural network, artificial neural network","Artificial neural networks provide a unique computing architecture whose potential has attracted interest from researchers across different disciplines. As a technique for computational analysis, neural network technology is very well suited for the analysis of molecular sequence data.

A comparison of Cox proportional hazards and artificial neural network models for medical prognosis,other,neural network,"Modeling survival of populations and establishing prognoses for individual patients are important activities in the practice of medicine. For patients with diseases that may extend for several years, in particular, accurate assessment of survival probabilities is essential. New methods, such as neural networks, have been used increasingly to model disease progression. Their advantages and disadvantages, when compared to statistical methods such as Cox proportional hazards, have seldom been explored in real-world data. In this study, we compare the performances of a Cox model and a neural network model that are used as prognostic tools for a set of people living with AIDS. We modeled disease progressions for patients who had AIDS (according to the 1993 CDC definition) in a set of 588 patients in California, using data from the ATHOS project. We divided the study population into 10 training and 10 test sets and evaluated the prognostic accuracy of a Cox proportional hazards model and of a neural network model by determining sensitivities, specificities, positive and negative predictive values for an arbitrary threshold (0.5), and the areas under the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves that utilized all possible thresholds for intervals of 1 yr following the diagnosis of AIDS. There was no evidence that the Cox model performed better than did the neural network model or vice versa, but the former method had the advantage of providing some insight on which variables were most influential for prognosis. Nevertheless, it is likely that the assumptions required by the Cox model may not be satisfied in all data sets, justifying the use of neural networks in certain cases."
Artificial neural network prediction of ascites in broilers,other,"neural network, artificial neural network","An artificial neural network was trained to predict the presence or absence of ascites in broiler chickens. The neural network was a three-layer back-propagation neural network with an input layer of 15 neurons (defining 15 physiological variables), a hidden layer of 16 neurons, and an output layer of 2 neurons (the presence or absence of ascites). Male by-products of a breeder pullet line were brooded at 32 and 30 C during Weeks 1 and 2, respectively. The training set for the neural network consisted of data from birds subjected to cool temperatures (18 C) to induce ascites. After training, the predictive ability of the neural network was verified with two new data sets. The second data set was from birds subjected to cool temperatures (18 C). The third data set was from birds subjected to clamping of the pulmonary artery to simulate the physiological processes involved in ascites (the temperature was 24 C). A comparison was made between laboratory diagnostic results and the neural network predicted ascites incidence. The neural network accurately identified the presence or absence of ascites in the first (training) set. Two false positives and one false positive were identified in the second and third verification sets, respectively. The birds identified as false positives were determined to be in the developmental stages of ascites before the occurrence of fluid accumulation. Artificial neural networks were found to effectively identify broilers with and without ascites."
Prediction of outcome in critically ill patients using artificial neural network synthesised by genetic algorithm,other,"neural network, artificial neural network","BACKGROUND: Decisions about which patients to admit to intensive care and how long to keep them there are difficult. A flexible computer-based mathematical model which is sensitive to the complexity of intensive care medicine, and which accurately models prognosis, seems highly desirable.
METHODS: We have created, optimised by genetic algorithms, trained, and evaluated the performance of an artificial neural network (ANN) in the clinical setting of systemic inflammatory response syndrome and haemodynamic shock. 258 patients were selected from an intensive care database of 4484 patients at a London teaching hospital and randomised to a network training set (168) and a test set (90). The outcome evaluated was death during that hospital admission and the performance of the neural net was compared (by receiver operating characteristic [ROC] curves and by Brier scores) with that of a logistic regression model.
FINDINGS: Artificial neural network performance increased with successive generations; the best-performing ANN was created after 7 generations and predicted outcome more accurately than the logistic regression model (ROC curve area 0.863 vs 0.753).
INTERPRETATION: In this study, ANNs have lent themselves particularly well to modelling a complex clinical situation; we suggest that this relates to their inherently flexible nature which accommodates interactions between the clinical input fields. In addition, we have demonstrated the value of a second computational technique (genetic algorithms) in ""tuning"" ANN performance. These techniques can potentially be implemented in individual intensive care units; the outcome models which they will generate will be sensitive to local practice. Analysis of such accurate clinical outcome models may empower clinicians with a hitherto unappreciated degree of insight into those elements of their clinical practice which are most relevant to their patients' outcome."
One-year mortality prognosis in heart failure: a neural network approach based on echocardiographic data,other,"neural network, artificial neural network","OBJECTIVES: This study sought to assess the usefulness and accuracy of artificial neural networks in the prognosis of 1-year mortality in patients with heart failure.
BACKGROUND: Artificial neural networks is a computational technique used to represent and process information by means of networks of interconnected processing elements, similar to neurons. They have found applications in medical decision support systems, particularly in prognosis.
METHODS: Clinical and Doppler-derived echocardiographic data from 95 consecutive patients with diffuse impairment of myocardial contractility were studied. After 1 year, data regarding survival or death were obtained and produced the prognostic variable. The data base was divided randomly into a training data set (47 cases, 8 deaths) and a testing data set (48 cases, 7 deaths). Results of artificial neural network classification were compared with those from linear discriminant analysis, clinical judgment and conventional heuristically based programs.
RESULTS: The study group included 57 male (47 survivors) and 38 female patients (33 survivors). Linear discriminant analysis was not efficient for separating survivors from nonsurvivors because the accuracy at the ideal cutoff value was only 67.4%, with a sensitivity of 67.5%, positive predictive value of 27.8% and negative predictive value of 91.5%. In contrast, all artificial neural networks were able to predict outcome with an accuracy of 90%, specificity of 93% and sensitivity of 71.4%, for the best artificial neural network. Both clinical judgment and automatic heuristic methods were also inferior in performance.
CONCLUSIONS: The artificial neural network method has proved to be reliable for implementing quantitative prognosis of mortality in patients with heart failure. Additional studies with larger numbers of patients are required to better assess the usefulness of artificial neural networks."
Peptide sequence determination from high-energy collision-induced dissociation spectra using artificial neural networks,other,"neural network, artificial neural network","This paper reports a newly developed technique that uses artificial neural networks to aid in the automated interpretation of peptide sequence from high-energy collision-induced dissociation (CID) tandem mass spectra of peptides. Two artificial neural networks classify fragment ions before the commencement of an iterative sequencing algorithm. The first neural network provides an estimation of whether fragment ions belong to 1 of 11 specific categories, whereas the second network attempts to determine to which category each ion belongs. Based upon numerical results from the two networks, the program generates an idealized spectrum that contains only a single ion type. From this simplified spectrum, the program's sequencing module, which incorporates a small rule base of fragmentation knowledge, directly generates sequences in a stepwise fashion through a high-speed iterative process. The results with this prototype algorithm, in which the neural networks were trained on a set of reference spectra, suggest that this method is a viable approach to rapid computer interpretation of peptide CID spectra."
A neural network model for survival data,other,"neural network, feedforward neural network","Neural networks have received considerable attention recently, mostly by non-statisticians. They are considered by many to be very promising tools for classification and prediction. In this paper we present an approach to modelling censored survival data using the input-output relationship associated with a simple feed-forward neural network as the basis for a non-linear proportional hazards model. This approach can be extended to other models used with censored survival data. The proportional hazards neural network parameters are estimated using the method of maximum likelihood. These maximum likelihood based models can be compared, using readily available techniques such as the likelihood ratio test and the Akaike criterion. The neural network models are illustrated using data on the survival of men with prostatic carcinoma. A method of interpreting the neural network predictions based on the factorial contrasts is presented."
CLINICAL/MEDICAL OUTCOME PREDICTION BY NEURAL NETWORKS WITH STATISTICAL ENHANCEMENT,other,neural network,"Neural networks offer a powerful new approach to information processing through their ability to generalize from a specific training data set. The success of this approach has raised interesting new possibilities of incorporating statistical methodology in order to enhance their predictive ability. This paper reports on two complementary methods of prediction. one using neural networks and the other using traditional statistical methods. The two methods are compared on the basis of their prediction applied to standardized developmental infant outcome measures using preselected infant and maternal variables measured at birth. Three neural network algorithms were employed. In our study, no one network outperformed the other two consistently. The neural networks provided significantly better results than the regression model in terms of variation and prediction of extreme outcomes. Finally we demonstrated that selection of relevant input variables through statistical means can produce a reduced network structure with no loss in predictive ability."
A comparison of two computer-based prognostic systems for AIDS,other,neural network,"We compare the performances of a Cox model and a neural network model that are used as prognostic tools for a cohort of people living with AIDS. We modeled disease progression for patients who had AIDS (according to the 1993 CDC definition) in a cohort of 588 patients in California, using data from the ATHOS project. We divided the study population into 10 training and 10 test sets and evaluated the prognostic accuracy of a Cox proportional hazards model and of a neural network model by determining the number of predicted deaths, the sensitivities, specificities, positive predictive values, and negative predictive values for intervals of one year following the diagnosis of AIDS. For the Cox model, we further tested the agreement between a series of binary observations, representing death in one, two, and three years, and a set of estimates which define the probability of survival for those intervals. Both models were able to provide accurate numbers on how many patients were likely to die at each interval, and reasonable individualized estimates for the two- and three-year survival of a given patient, but failed to provide reliable predictions for the first year after diagnosis. There was no evidence that the Cox model performed better than did the neural network model or vice-versa, but the former method had the advantage of providing some insight on which variables were most influential for prognosis. Nevertheless, it is likely that the assumptions required by the Cox model may not be satisfied in all data sets, justifying the use of neural networks in certain cases."
Prediction of valve-related complications for artificial heart valves using adaptive neural networks: a preliminary study,other,"neural network, artificial neural network","A novel approach to the prediction of valve-related complications in patients with implanted artificial heart valves is discussed. Adaptive artificial neural networks were used to identify patients at high risk of valve-related events based on preoperative data. Data from a clinical trial on 789 subjects with Carpentier-Edwards pericardial bioprostheses were used. Patients' records were divided into two groups, one of which was used for training the neural network and the other for testing the trained network and determining error rates. Patient information such as age, sex, NYHA class and anticoagulation therapy, as well as valve information such as size and the date of implant, were used as the network inputs. The neural net had a single output variable indicating the risk that an individual patient would develop a valve-related complication resulting in death. The results show that a trained neural network was able to predict valve-related deaths in the specified time interval of 1981-1991 with a high degree of accuracy. The neural network was also successful in classifying patients into high and low risk categories."
Advanced ovarian cancer. Neural network analysis to predict treatment outcome,other,neural network,"BACKGROUND: Quantitative methods for the analysis of prognostic information are important in order to use this knowledge optimally. The neural network is a new quantitative method where the fundamental building blocks are units which can be likened to neurons, and weighted connections which can be likened to synapses. The more the hidden units, the more complex the patterns that can be learnt.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data from two Dutch studies in ovarian cancer were used to compare the previously reported survival rates predicted by the Cox's prognostic index with the prediction obtained by a neural network.
RESULTS: Both the Cox's analysis and the neural network agreed on residual tumour size, stage, and performance status as being important for survival. The neural network identified additional predictive factors such as place of diagnosis and age. As the Cox's prognostic index has not been tested to predict survival on an independent data set a comparison with the results obtained in the neural network test set could not be performed.
CONCLUSIONS: Neural networks perform at least as well as Cox's method for the prediction of survival, and prognostic factors can easily be identified. The analysis not only revealed the predictive power of some characteristics, but also the non-predictive power of the others."
"Modeling mortality in the intensive care unit: comparing the performance of a back-propagation, associative-learning neural network with multivariate logistic regression",other,neural network,"The objective of this study was to compare and contrast two techniques of modeling mortality in a 30 bed multi-disciplinary ICU; neural networks and logistic regression. Fifteen physiological variables were recorded on day 3 for 422 consecutive patients whose duration of stay was over 72 hours. Two separate models were built using each technique. First, logistic and neural network models were constructed on the complete 422 patient dataset and discrimination was compared. Second, the database was randomly divided into a 284 patient developmental dataset and a 138 patient validation dataset. The developmental dataset was used to construct logistic and neural net models and the predictive power of these models was verified on the validation dataset. On the complete dataset, the neural network clearly outperformed the logistic model (sensitivity and specificity of 1 and .997 vs. .525 and .966, area under ROC curve .9993 vs. .9259), while both performed equally well on the validation dataset (area under ROC of .82). The excellent performance of the neural net on the complete dataset reveals that the problem is classifiable. Since our dataset only contained 40 mortality events, it is highly likely that the validation dataset was not representative of the developmental dataset, which led to a decreased predictive performance by both the neural net and the logistic regression models. Theoretically, given an extensive dataset, the neural network should be able to perform mortality prediction with a sensitivity and a specificity approaching 95%. Clinically, this would be an extremely important achievement.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
Neural networks for molecular sequence classification,other,neural network,"A neural network classification method has been developed as an alternative approach to the search/organization problem of large molecular databases. Two artificial neural systems have been implemented on a Cray supercomputer for rapid protein/nucleic acid sequence classifications. The neural networks used are three-layered, feed-forward networks that employ back-propagation learning algorithm. The molecular sequences are encoded into neural input vectors by applying an n-gram hashing method or a SVD (singular value decomposition) method. Once trained with known sequences in the molecular databases, the neural system becomes an associative memory capable of classifying unknown sequences based on the class information embedded in its neural interconnections. The protein system, which classifies proteins into PIR (Protein Identification Resource) superfamilies, showed a 82% to a close to 100% sensitivity at a speed that is about an order of magnitude faster than other search methods. The pilot nucleic acid system, which classifies ribosomal RNA sequences according to phylogenetic groups, has achieved a 100% classification accuracy. The system could be used to reduce the database search time and help organize the molecular sequence databases. The tool is generally applicable to any databases that are organized according to family relationships."
A practical application of neural network analysis for predicting outcome of individual breast cancer patients,other,neural network,"It has been previously shown that Neural Networks can be trained to recognize individual breast cancer patients at high and low risk for recurrent disease and death. This paper expands on the initial investigation and shows that by coding time as one of the prognostic variables, a Neural Network can use censored survival data to predict patient outcome over time. In this demonstration a Neural Network was trained, tested, and validated using censored survival data from a group of 1373 patients with node-positive breast cancer. The Neural Network method predicted patient outcome as accurately as Cox Regression modeling. The final Neural Network model can be presented with a patient's prognostic information and make a series of predictions about probability of relapse at different times of follow-up, allowing one to draw survival probability curves for individual patients."
Explainable AI and transformer models: Unraveling the nutritional influences on Alzheimer's disease mortality,other,machine learning model,"This pioneering study introduces the use of transformer-based machine learning models and explainable AI approaches to explore the impact of nutrition on Alzheimer's disease (AD) mortality. Using data from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (Nhanes iii 1988 to 1994) and the NHANES III Mortality-Linked File (2019) databases, we investigate the intricate relationship between various nutritional factors and AD mortality. Our approach features a novel application of transformer models, which are then benchmarked against established methods like random forests and support vector machines. This comparison not only underscores the strengths of transformer models in handling complex medical datasets but also highlights their potential for providing deeper insights into disease progression. Key findings, such as the significant roles of Platelet distribution width in AD mortality in transformer and Serum Vitamin B12 in random forest, are enhanced by the use of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), particularly the Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) and the integrated gradient methods. This study serves as a vital step forward in applying advanced AI techniques to medical research, offering new perspectives in understanding and combating Alzheimer's Disease."
Artificial intelligence in scientific medical writing: Legitimate and deceptive uses and ethical concerns,other,neural network,"The debate surrounding the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into scientific writing has already attracted significant interest in medical and life sciences. While AI can undoubtedly expedite the process of manuscript creation and correction, it raises several criticisms. The crossover between AI and health sciences is relatively recent, but the use of AI tools among physicians and other scientists who work in the life sciences is growing very fast. Within this whirlwind, it is becoming essential to realize where we are heading and what the limits are, including an ethical perspective. Modern conversational AIs exhibit a context awareness that enables them to understand and remember any conversation beyond any predefined script. Even more impressively, they can learn and adapt as they engage with a growing volume of human language input. They all share neural networks as background mathematical models and differ from old chatbots for their use of a specific network architecture called transformer model [1]. Some of them exceed 100 terabytes (TB) (e.g., Bloom, LaMDA) or even 500 TB (e.g., Megatron-Turing NLG) of text data, the 4.0 version of ChatGPT (GPT-4) was trained with nearly 45 TB, but stays updated by the internet connection and may integrate with different plugins that enhance its functionality, making it multimodal."
Path-BigBird: An AI-Driven Transformer Approach to Classification of Cancer Pathology Reports,other,None,"PURPOSE: Surgical pathology reports are critical for cancer diagnosis and management. To accurately extract information about tumor characteristics from pathology reports in near real time, we explore the impact of using domain-specific transformer models that understand cancer pathology reports.
METHODS: We built a pathology transformer model, Path-BigBird, by using 2.7 million pathology reports from six SEER cancer registries. We then compare different variations of Path-BigBird with two less computationally intensive methods: Hierarchical Self-Attention Network (HiSAN) classification model and an off-the-shelf clinical transformer model (Clinical BigBird). We use five pathology information extraction tasks for evaluation: site, subsite, laterality, histology, and behavior. Model performance is evaluated by using macro and micro F<sub>1</sub> scores.
RESULTS: We found that Path-BigBird and Clinical BigBird outperformed the HiSAN in all tasks. Clinical BigBird performed better on the site and laterality tasks. Versions of the Path-BigBird model performed best on the two most difficult tasks: subsite (micro F<sub>1</sub> score of 72.53, macro F<sub>1</sub> score of 35.76) and histology (micro F<sub>1</sub> score of 80.96, macro F<sub>1</sub> score of 37.94). The largest performance gains over the HiSAN model were for histology, for which a Path-BigBird model increased the micro F<sub>1</sub> score by 1.44 points and the macro F<sub>1</sub> score by 3.55 points. Overall, the results suggest that a Path-BigBird model with a vocabulary derived from well-curated and deidentified data is the best-performing model.
CONCLUSION: The Path-BigBird pathology transformer model improves automated information extraction from pathology reports. Although Path-BigBird outperforms Clinical BigBird and HiSAN, these less computationally expensive models still have utility when resources are constrained."
A rigorous theoretical and numerical analysis of a nonlinear reaction-diffusion epidemic model pertaining dynamics of COVID-19,other,None,"The spatial movement of the human population from one region to another and the existence of super-spreaders are the main factors that enhanced the disease incidence. Super-spreaders refer to the individuals having transmitting ability to multiple pathogens. In this article, an epidemic model with spatial and temporal effects is formulated to analyze the impact of some preventing measures of COVID-19. The model is developed using six nonlinear partial differential equations. The infectious individuals are sub-divided into symptomatic, asymptomatic and super-spreader classes. In this study, we focused on the rigorous qualitative analysis of the reaction-diffusion model. The fundamental mathematical properties of the proposed COVID-19 epidemic model such as boundedness, positivity, and invariant region of the problem solution are derived, which ensure the validity of the proposed model. The model equilibria and its stability analysis for both local and global cases have been presented. The normalized sensitivity analysis of the model is carried out in order to observe the crucial factors in the transmission of infection. Furthermore, an efficient numerical scheme is applied to solve the proposed model and detailed simulation are performed. Based on the graphical observation, diffusion in the context of confined public gatherings is observed to significantly inhibit the spread of infection when compared to the absence of diffusion. This is especially important in scenarios where super-spreaders may play a major role in transmission. The impact of some non-pharmaceutical interventions are illustrated graphically with and without diffusion. We believe that the present investigation will be beneficial in understanding the complex dynamics and control of COVID-19 under various non-pharmaceutical interventions."
On cognitive epidemic models: spatial segregation versus nonpharmaceutical interventions,other,None,"Fick's law and the Fokker-Planck law of diffusion are applied to manifest the cognitive dispersal of individuals in two reaction-diffusion SEIR epidemic models, where the disease transmission is illustrated by nonlocal infection mechanisms in heterogeneous environments. Building upon the well-posedness of solutions, threshold dynamics are discussed in terms of the basic reproduction numbers for the two cognitive epidemic models. The numerical investigation reveals that the Fokker-Planck law can better describe the diffusion of individuals by taking different dispersal strategies of exposed individuals in our cognitive epidemic models, and provides some insights on spatial segregation and nonpharmaceutical interventions: (i) spatial segregation occurs in the random diffusion model when the nonlocal infection radius is small, while it appears in the symmetric diffusion model when the radius is large; (ii) nonpharmaceutical interventions on restricting the dispersal of exposed and infected individuals do not contribute to reducing the infection proportion, but rather eliminate the disease in a region, which expands as the nonlocal infection radius increases. We additionally find that the final infection size in the random diffusion model is significantly smaller than that in the symmetric diffusion model and decreases as the nonlocal infection radius increases."
Spatial-temporal diffusion model of aggregated infectious diseases based on population life characteristics: a case study of COVID-19,other,None,"Outbreaks of infectious diseases pose significant threats to human life, and countries around the world need to implement more precise prevention and control measures to contain the spread of viruses. In this study, we propose a spatial-temporal diffusion model of infectious diseases under a discrete grid, based on the time series prediction of infectious diseases, to model the diffusion process of viruses in population. This model uses the estimated outbreak origin as the center of transmission, employing a tree-like structure of daily human travel to generalize the process of viral spread within the population. By incorporating diverse data, it simulates the congregation of people, thus quantifying the flow weights between grids for population movement. The model is validated with some Chinese cities with COVID-19 outbreaks, and the results show that the outbreak point estimation method could better estimate the virus transmission center of the epidemic. The estimated location of the outbreak point in Xi'an was only 0.965 km different from the actual one, and the results were more satisfactory. The spatiotemporal diffusion model for infectious diseases simulates daily newly infected areas, which effectively cover the actual patient infection zones on the same day. During the mid-stage of viral transmission, the coverage rate can increase to over 90%, compared to related research, this method has improved simulation accuracy by approximately 18%. This study can provide technical support for epidemic prevention and control, and assist decision-makers in developing more scientific and efficient epidemic prevention and control policies."
Basic reproduction ratio of a mosquito-borne disease in heterogeneous environment,other,None,"To explore the influence of spatial heterogeneity on mosquito-borne diseases, we formulate a reaction-diffusion model with general incidence rates. The basic reproduction ratio [Formula: see text] for this model is introduced and the threshold dynamics in terms of [Formula: see text] are obtained. In the case where the model is spatially homogeneous, the global asymptotic stability of the endemic equilibrium is proved when [Formula: see text]. Under appropriate conditions, we establish the asymptotic profiles of [Formula: see text] in the case of small or large diffusion rates, and investigate the monotonicity of [Formula: see text] with respect to the heterogeneous diffusion coefficients. Numerically, the proposed model is applied to study the dengue fever transmission. Via performing simulations on the impacts of certain factors on [Formula: see text] and disease dynamics, we find some novel and interesting phenomena which can provide valuable information for the targeted implementation of disease control measures."
Machine learning-based multimodal prediction of language outcomes in chronic aphasia,other,None,"Recent studies have combined multiple neuroimaging modalities to gain further understanding of the neurobiological substrates of aphasia. Following this line of work, the current study uses machine learning approaches to predict aphasia severity and specific language measures based on a multimodal neuroimaging dataset. A total of 116 individuals with chronic left-hemisphere stroke were included in the study. Neuroimaging data included task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), diffusion-based fractional anisotropy (FA)-values, cerebral blood flow (CBF), and lesion-load data. The Western Aphasia Battery was used to measure aphasia severity and specific language functions. As a primary analysis, we constructed support vector regression (SVR) models predicting language measures based on (i) each neuroimaging modality separately, (ii) lesion volume alone, and (iii) a combination of all modalities. Prediction accuracy across models was subsequently statistically compared. Prediction accuracy across modalities and language measures varied substantially (predicted vs. empirical correlation range: r = .00-.67). The multimodal prediction model yielded the most accurate prediction in all cases (r = .53-.67). Statistical superiority in favor of the multimodal model was achieved in 28/30 model comparisons (p-value range: <.001-.046). Our results indicate that different neuroimaging modalities carry complementary information that can be integrated to more accurately depict how brain damage and remaining functionality of intact brain tissue translate into language function in aphasia."
Indirect interactions influence contact network structure and diffusion dynamics,other,None,"Interaction patterns at the individual level influence the behaviour of diffusion over contact networks. Most of the current diffusion models only consider direct interactions, capable of transferring infectious items among individuals, to build transmission networks of diffusion. However, delayed indirect interactions, where a susceptible individual interacts with infectious items after the infected individual has left the interaction space, can also cause transmission events. We define a diffusion model called the same place different time transmission (SPDT)-based diffusion that considers transmission links for these indirect interactions. Our SPDT model changes the network dynamics where the connectivity among individuals varies with the decay rates of link infectivity. We investigate SPDT diffusion behaviours by simulating airborne disease spreading on data-driven contact networks. The SPDT model significantly increases diffusion dynamics with a high rate of disease transmission. By making the underlying connectivity denser and stronger due to the inclusion of indirect transmissions, SPDT models are more realistic than same place same time transmission (SPST)-based models for the study of various airborne disease outbreaks. Importantly, we also find that the diffusion dynamics including indirect links are not reproducible by the current SPST models based on direct links, even if both SPDT and SPST networks assume the same underlying connectivity. This is because the transmission dynamics of indirect links are different from those of direct links. These outcomes highlight the importance of the indirect links for predicting outbreaks of airborne diseases."
Estimating Future Health Technology Diffusion Using Expert Beliefs Calibrated to an Established Diffusion Model,other,None,"OBJECTIVES: Estimates of future health technology diffusion, or future uptake over time, are a requirement for different analyses performed within health technology assessments. Methods for obtaining such estimates include constant uptake estimates based on expert opinion or analogous technologies and on extrapolation from initial data points using parametric curves-but remain divorced from established diffusion theory and modeling. We propose an approach to obtaining diffusion estimates using experts' beliefs calibrated to an established diffusion model to address this methodologic gap.
METHODS: We performed an elicitation of experts' beliefs on future diffusion of a new preterm birth screening illustrative case study technology. The elicited quantities were chosen such that they could be calibrated to yield the parameters of the Bass model of new product growth, which was chosen based on a review of the diffusion literature.
RESULTS: With the elicitation of only three quantities per diffusion curve, our approach enabled us to quantify uncertainty about diffusion of the new technology in different scenarios. Pooled results showed that the attainable number of adoptions was predicted to be relatively low compared with what was thought possible. Further research evidence improved the attainable number of adoptions only slightly but resulted in greater speed of diffusion.
CONCLUSIONS: The proposed approach of eliciting experts' beliefs about diffusion and informing the Bass model has the potential to fill the methodologic gap evident in value of implementation and research, as well as budget impact and some cost-effectiveness analyses."
Optimal control of anthracnose using mixed strategies,other,None,"In this paper we propose and study a spatial diffusion model for the control of anthracnose disease in a bounded domain. The model is a generalization of the one previously developed in [15]. We use the model to simulate two different types of control strategies against anthracnose disease. Strategies that employ chemical fungicides are modeled using a continuous control function; while strategies that rely on cultivational practices (such as pruning and removal of mummified fruits) are modeled with a control function which is discrete in time (though not in space). For comparative purposes, we perform our analyses for a spatially-averaged model as well as the space-dependent diffusion model. Under weak smoothness conditions on parameters we demonstrate the well-posedness of both models by verifying existence and uniqueness of the solution for the growth inhibition rate for given initial conditions. We also show that the set [0, 1] is positively invariant. We first study control by impulsive strategies, then analyze the simultaneous use of mixed continuous and pulse strategies. In each case we specify a cost functional to be minimized, and we demonstrate the existence of optimal control strategies. In the case of pulse-only strategies, we provide explicit algorithms for finding the optimal control strategies for both the spatially-averaged model and the space-dependent model. We verify the algorithms for both models via simulation, and discuss properties of the optimal solutions."
The diffusion of docetaxel in patients with metastatic prostate cancer,other,None,"BACKGROUND: Diffusion of new cancer treatments can be both inefficient and incomplete. The uptake of new treatments over time (diffusion) has not been well studied. We analyzed the diffusion of docetaxel in metastatic prostate cancer.
METHODS: We identified metastatic prostate cancer patients diagnosed from 1995 to 2007 using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program (SEER)-Medicare database. Medicare claims through 2008 were analyzed. We assessed cumulative incidence of docetaxel by socioeconomic, demographic, and comorbidity variables, and compared diffusion patterns to landmark events including release of phase III results and FDA approval dates. We compared docetaxel diffusion patterns in prostate cancer to those in metastatic breast, lung, ovarian, and gastric cancers. To model docetaxel use over time, we used the classic ""mixed influence"" deterministic diffusion model. All statistical tests were two-sided.
RESULTS: We identified 6561 metastatic prostate cancer patients; 1350 subsequently received chemotherapy. Among patients who received chemotherapy, docetaxel use was 95% by 2008. Docetaxel uptake was statistically significantly slower (P < .01) for patients older than 65 years, blacks, patients in lower income areas, and those who experienced poverty. Eighty percent of docetaxel diffusion occurred prior to the May, 2004 release of phase III results showing superiority of docetaxel over standard-of-care. The maximum increase in the rate of use of docetaxel occurred nearly simultaneously for prostate cancer as for all other cancers combined (in 2000).
CONCLUSION: Efforts to increase the diffusion of treatments with proven survival benefits among disadvantaged populations could lead to cancer population survival gains. Docetaxel diffusion mostly preceded phase III evidence for its efficacy in castration-resistant prostate cancer, and appeared to be a cancer-wide-rather than a disease-specific-phenomenon. Diffusion prior to definitive evidence indicates the prevalence of off-label chemotherapy use."
Dynamics of an HBV model with diffusion and delay,other,None,"In this paper we model and analyze the hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in a diffusion model confined to a finite domain, induced by intracellular time delay between infection of a cell and production of new virus particles. The equilibrium solutions are obtained and the stability is analyzed if the space is assumed as homogeneous. When the space is inhomogeneous, the effects of diffusion and intracellular time delay are obtained by computer simulations."
Traveling waves and spread rates for a West Nile virus model,other,None,"A reaction-diffusion model for the spatial spread of West Nile virus is developed and analysed. Infection dynamics are based on a modified version of a model for cross infection between birds and mosquitoes (Wonham et al., 2004, An epidemiological model for West-Nile virus: Invasion analysis and control application. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B 271), and diffusion terms describe movement of birds and mosquitoes. Working with a simplified version of the model, the cooperative nature of cross-infection dynamics is utilized to prove the existence of traveling waves and to calculate the spatial spread rate of infection. Comparison theorem results are used to show that the spread rate of the simplified model may provide an upper bound for the spread rate of a more realistic and complex version of the model."
On the dynamics of dengue epidemics from large-scale information,other,None,A model for the spatial and temporal dynamics of dengue fever is proposed in this article. The vector population dynamics is derived from a diffusion equation that is based on environmental parameters at the scale of a remote-sensing image. Vectors and hosts populations are then classically divided into compartments corresponding to their respective disease status. The transmission processes between hosts and vectors are described by a set of differential equations. The link between the vector population diffusion model and the compartmental model enables one to describe both the spatial and temporal dynamics of the disease. Simulations in artificial and actual landscapes show the advantage of using remotely sensed and complementary meteorological data for modelling in a realistic way the geographic spread of a vector-borne disease such as dengue fever.
Genetic evidence supports demic diffusion of Han culture,other,None,"The spread of culture and language in human populations is explained by two alternative models: the demic diffusion model, which involves mass movement of people; and the cultural diffusion model, which refers to cultural impact between populations and involves limited genetic exchange between them. The mechanism of the peopling of Europe has long been debated, a key issue being whether the diffusion of agriculture and language from the Near East was concomitant with a large movement of farmers. Here we show, by systematically analysing Y-chromosome and mitochondrial DNA variation in Han populations, that the pattern of the southward expansion of Han culture is consistent with the demic diffusion model, and that males played a larger role than females in this expansion. The Han people, who all share the same culture and language, exceed 1.16 billion (2000 census), and are by far the largest ethnic group in the world. The expansion process of Han culture is thus of great interest to researchers in many fields."
Diffusion theory and drug use,other,None,"This paper examines the applicability of the diffusion model to drug use. A variety of studies that employ the diffusion model to examine drug-related behaviour, including the use of alcohol, tobacco and illicit drugs, are discussed. Studies include those that focus on ""natural"" or spontaneous diffusion and those in which diffusion of a drug or a drug-related intervention is planned. Most studies examined support the application of the diffusion model in the study of drug use. The model is particularly valuable when new substances are introduced to a population or subgroup. The addition of economic and other forms of availability as a determinant of adoption would increase the power of the model. Recommended directions for research are outlined. The diffusion model has been used successfully in the study of drug use for several decades. More rigorous designs would strengthen this type of research and provide direction for policymakers and those involved in public health and education."
